[Doc_9_PTLD_Malignancy:chunk_000] 1.1 Definition and Epidemiology
Tokens: 100
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Definition: PTLD is a lymphoid proliferation disorder developing after organ transplantation, ranging from early lymphoid hyperplasia to frank lymphoma (typically B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma or Hodgkin-like disease). Incidence by organ type:
Intestine: 20-30% (highest risk)
Heart: 5-10%
Lung: 5-10%
Liver: 2-5% (relatively low; liver immunologically privileged)
Kidney: 1-4%

Risk factors for PTLD:
EBV seronegative recipient (D+R−): 5-10% risk vs. <1% in seropositive recipients
T-cell depleting induction: rATG, alemtuzumab → 2-3× higher risk vs. basiliximab
High CNI/antimetabolite levels: Intense immunosuppression
Organ type: Intestine > Heart/Lung > Liver/Kidney
Age: Pediatric recipients higher risk than adults
Repeated episodes of rejection: Treated with augmented IS

[Doc_9_PTLD_Malignancy:chunk_001] 1.5 Diagnosis
Tokens: 145
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laboratory studies:
EBV PCR (quantitative): Elevated EBV load (>100,000 copies/mL) concerning but not diagnostic
CBC: Leukocytosis, atypical lymphocytosis, anemia, or thrombocytopenia
LFTs, renal function: Assess organ involvement
Lactate dehydrogenase: Elevated in lymphoma; prognostic marker

Imaging:
CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: Nodal size, organ involvement, extranodal disease
PET-CT: Functional imaging; avidity helps differentiate PTLD from inflammation/infection; staging
Endoscopy/colonoscopy: If GI involvement suspected (obtain biopsies)

Histopathology (mandatory for diagnosis):
Biopsy: Excision preferred; core biopsy acceptable if excision not feasible
Immunophenotyping: Flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry to assess clonality (monoclonal vs. polyclonal)
EBV testing: EBER in situ hybridization (quantify EBV+ cells)
Cytogenetics/molecular: For monomorphic PTLD (Myc translocation in Burkitt, etc.) Staging (Lugano classification for lymphomas):
Stage I: Single nodal group or single extranodal organ
Stage II: Multiple nodal groups or localized extranodal involvement
Stage III: Involvement of abdomen and/or above diaphragm
Stage IV: Diffuse involvement, marrow, CNS, or multiple extranodal sites

[Doc_9_PTLD_Malignancy:chunk_002] 3.2 Skin Cancers (Most Common)
Tokens: 144
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epidemiology:
40-50× higher risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) vs. general population
10× higher risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC)
3-5× higher melanoma risk
Merkel cell carcinoma: 20-40× higher

Risk factors:
Duration and intensity of immunosuppression (especially CNI, higher risk than mTOR)
UV exposure (latitude, outdoor activities)
Age at transplantation
Skin phototype (fair skin > dark skin)
Prior skin cancer history

Presentation:
SCC: Often in sun-exposed areas; rapid growth; can be aggressive
BCC: Basal cell type; slower growth; rarely metastasizes
Melanoma: Can be aggressive; early detection critical

Management:
Surveillance: Annual full-body skin examination by dermatologist; self-examination monthly
Prevention: Strict sun protection (SPF 50+, protective clothing, limited sun exposure 10 AM-4 PM)
Treatment: Excision with clear margins; Mohs micrographic surgery for select SCC; consider sentinel node biopsy for melanoma
IS modification: Consider mTOR inhibitor (sirolimus) conversion for recurrent skin cancers; some evidence for reduced recurrence

[Doc_9_PTLD_Malignancy:chunk_003] 3.3 Solid Tumors (Organ-Specific)
Tokens: 208
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC):
3-6× higher incidence in transplant recipients
Often in native kidneys (can occur in allograft)
Risk factors: Chronic kidney disease, smoking, obesity, immunosuppression
Presentation: Hematuria, flank pain, constitutional symptoms
Screening: Annual ultrasound or CT (no clear benefit shown; surveillance tailored to risk)
Management: Nephrectomy (native or allograft depending on location/size); systemic therapy for metastatic disease

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC):
High risk in liver transplant recipients with HCV or HBV
Also occurs in non-viral liver disease
Screening: Ultrasound ± AFP every 3-4 months in high-risk recipients
Management: Resection, transplantation (if within Milan criteria), ablation, or systemic therapy

Lung cancer:
Increased risk, especially in smokers
Screening: Consider low-dose CT in high-risk (smokers, significant smoking history)
Management: Standard oncologic approaches (resection, chemo, immunotherapy)

Colorectal, breast, prostate, cervical cancer:
Modestly increased risk (2-3×)
Standard age-appropriate screening applies
Some centers recommend earlier/more frequent screening

Virus-associated cancers:
HPV-related: Cervical, anal, oropharyngeal cancers (higher risk; aggressive)
Vaccination pre- or post-transplant can reduce incidence
Screening: Pap smear (cervix), anal cytology in high-risk
HBV-related: HCC (in recipients with chronic HBV)
Screening: Ultrasound + AFP
HCV-related: HCC (in recipients with chronic HCV)
Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) cure HCV; may reduce HCC risk
Kaposi sarcoma (HHV-8): Rare in immunosuppressed non-HIV transplant recipients; more common in HIV+/HHV-8+ recipients
