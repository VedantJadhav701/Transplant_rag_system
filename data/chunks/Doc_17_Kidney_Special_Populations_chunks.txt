[Doc_17_Kidney_Special_Populations:chunk_000] 1.2 Evaluation Considerations
Tokens: 125
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Physiologic age vs. chronologic age:
Not all 80-year-olds have same physiologic capacity
Frailty assessment important (functional status, dependency, cognitive)
Some 80-year-olds better candidates than some 60-year-olds

Cardiovascular assessment (critical in elderly):
Prevalence of CAD 30-50% in elderly
Stress testing: Recommended even without symptoms (high pretest probability)
Coronary angiography: If stress test abnormal or very high risk
Echocardiography: Assess LVEF, diastolic dysfunction
Optimization before transplant recommended (delay OK if medically needed)

Comorbidity burden:
Multiple chronic diseases expected (HTN, DM, prior MI, others)
Goal: Identify contraindications; optimize modifiable risk factors
Accept some risk (transplant still beneficial vs. dialysis)

Functional/cognitive assessment:
Can patient manage medications? ( adherence critical)
Support system present? ( family, social services)
Cognitive impairment? ( assess if able to consent)
Frailty? ( predicts perioperative complications)

[Doc_17_Kidney_Special_Populations:chunk_001] 2.4 Adherence and Transition
Tokens: 110
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adherence challenges (especially adolescence):
Normal developmental stage (testing boundaries, autonomy-seeking)
Medication burden (multiple daily doses)
Denial of illness ("I don't feel sick")
Peer pressure (embarrassment about medication)
Non-adherence → rejection → graft loss

Interventions to improve adherence:
Clear education: Importance of medications
Simplified regimens: Once-daily if possible (easier than multiple daily doses)
Adherence monitoring: Pharmacy refill checks, tacrolimus levels
Support systems: Case management, adolescent-focused clinics
Transition planning: Gradual shift from pediatric to adult care (age 18-21)

Transition to adult care:
Critical period: Age 16-21 (increased rejection risk during transition)
Structured program: Gradualy increase independence in self-management
Dual attendance: Pediatric and adult providers during overlap period
Support: Psychosocial services during transition

[Doc_17_Kidney_Special_Populations:chunk_002] 3.2 Causes of Disparities
Tokens: 105
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Biological factors:
HLA differences: African Americans have different HLA allele frequencies → harder to match with predominantly White donor pool
Immunogenicity: Some evidence for more vigorous immune response (vs. genetic)
Transplant quality: Often receive less well-matched organs (due to HLA pool)

Socioeconomic factors:
Healthcare access: Lower rates of transplant evaluation completion
Insurance barriers: Uninsured/underinsured → delays in care
Transportation: Geographic barriers to transplant centers
Health literacy: Variable understanding of transplant benefits
Systemic racism: Historical distrust of healthcare system (legacy of unethical research)

Immunosuppression factors:
Adherence barriers: Medication cost, complexity, side effects
CNI metabolism: Possible pharmacogenetic differences affecting tacrolimus levels
Drug interactions: Comorbidities requiring multiple medications

[Doc_17_Kidney_Special_Populations:chunk_003] 3.3 Strategies to Address Disparities
Tokens: 121
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Biological:
HLA allocation policy: OPTN revised allocation to give African American donors' organs extra priority for African American recipients (improves HLA matching)
Desensitization programs: Expand access to ABO-incompatible and HLA-incompatible transplants

Healthcare access:
Transplant education: Community outreach; reduce misinformation
Financial assistance: Copay programs; medication subsidies
Transportation support: Arrange rides; telemedicine when appropriate

Clinical:
Immunosuppression optimization:
Ensure therapeutic CNI levels (pharmacogenetic testing if available)
Maximize triple therapy (may use higher CNI targets)
Close monitoring for rejection
Adherence support:
Regular clinic visits (monitor compliance)
Pill organizers, reminders
Case management
Peer support programs
Comorbidity management:
Intensive hypertension control
Diabetes management
Early detection/treatment of rejection

Research:
Investigate genetic/immunologic factors underlying increased rejection
Study pharmacogenetics of CNI metabolism by race
Community-based participatory research to build trust

[Doc_17_Kidney_Special_Populations:chunk_004] 5. SUMMARY AND KEY CONCEPTS
Tokens: 100
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Elderly transplant: Safe option; benefit >dialysis despite shorter life expectancy; physiologic age key

2. Cardiovascular screening critical in elderly: Stress test recommended even without symptoms

3. Pediatric transplant: Excellent short-term outcomes; growth/adherence challenges in older children/adolescents

4. Steroid minimization critical in pediatric: Prevent growth retardation

5. Adolescent adherence: Major challenge; structured transition program essential

6. African American disparities: Complex (biological + socioeconomic); require multifactorial interventions

7. HLA allocation for African Americans: Improve matching; address biological disparities

8. Healthcare access improvements: Transplant education, financial assistance, transportation support
