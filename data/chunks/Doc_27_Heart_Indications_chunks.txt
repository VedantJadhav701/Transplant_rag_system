[Doc_27_Heart_Indications:chunk_000] 1.1 Primary Indications (Chronic Advanced Heart Failure)
Tokens: 183
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Candidate criteria (Class 1 recommendations):

| Criteria | Details | Target |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Peak VO2 <14 mL/kg/min | Severely limited exercise tolerance | Strongly indicates transplant benefit |
| NYHA Class III-IV refractory to medical therapy | Maximal medical management failed | Intractable symptoms |
| Inotrope-dependent | Requires continuous IV inotropes | Very limited prognosis without transplant |
| LVEF <20% | Severe systolic dysfunction | Criterion for consideration |
| Recurrent hospitalizations for CHF | Multiple admissions despite optimization | Quality of life severely impaired |

Etiology breakdown (% of transplants):

| Etiology | % | Notes |
|----------|---|-------|
| Ischemic cardiomyopathy | 35-40% | CAD with LVEF <20%; prior MI |
| Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) | 35-40% | Non-ischemic; genetic or viral |
| Restrictive cardiomyopathy | 5-10% | Amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, infiltrative |
| Valvular disease | 5-10% | Severe VHD unsuitable for repair |
| Congenital heart disease | 2-5% | Complex lesions; Eisenmenger syndrome |
| Retransplantation | 5-10% | Chronic rejection; recurrent disease |
| Other (myocarditis, peripartum, others) | 5-10% | Diverse etiologies |

[Doc_27_Heart_Indications:chunk_001] 2.1 Absolute Contraindications
Tokens: 143
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Contraindication | Rationale | Notes |
|-----------------|----------|-------|
| Uncontrolled active infection | Infection worsens with IS; sepsis incompatible | Must treat first; defer transplant |
| Irreversible severe pulmonary hypertension | RV failure post-transplant; death | PVR >6-8 mmHg/L; fixed PVR even with inhaled agents |
| Significant active malignancy | Metastatic disease; poor transplant outcomes | Full remission 5+ years preferred; type-dependent |
| Untreated severe psychiatric illness | Adherence risk; unstable | Must be stable/treated |
| Active substance abuse | Non-adherence; recidivism | Recent sobriety/rehabilitation required |
| Severe irreversible hepatic disease | Cannot metabolize IS; hepatic encephalopathy | Contraindication |
| Severe irreversible renal disease | Calcineurin inhibitor toxicity prohibitive | eGFR <20 problematic unless heart-kidney transplant |
| Persistent elevated pulmonary vascular resistance despite maximal pharmacotherapy | RV failure; graft failure | Challenge; borderline eGFR |

[Doc_27_Heart_Indications:chunk_002] 2.2 Relative Contraindications (Individualize)
Tokens: 189
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Contraindication | Assessment | Management |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|
| Age >65 years (vs. 70+) | Physiologic age; comorbidities | Often acceptable; outcomes reasonable |
| Diabetes mellitus (especially if poorly controlled) | Glycemic control; coronary disease | Achieve good control; not contraindication |
| Severe obesity (BMI >35-40) | Surgical complications; IS interactions | Weight loss program; consider individually |
| Active smoking | Graft coronary disease; lung disease | Must achieve durable cessation |
| Severe pulmonary hypertension (PVR 4-6 mmHg/L) | RV failure risk; may improve with inhaled agents | Trial inhaled vasodilators (nitric oxide, epoprostenol) |
| Significant CAD in recipient | Graft atherosclerosis if recipient disease present | Paradoxically may be benefit (transplant is new start) |
| Prior cardiac surgery | Increased operative difficulty, time | Not contraindication; technically feasible |
| Chronic kidney disease (eGFR 30-50) | CNI toxicity; proteinuria | Monitor closely; individualize |
| Fixed elevated PVR (despite inhaled agents) | RV failure post-transplant | Borderline contraindication; some centers try; risky |
| Hepatic dysfunction (elevated LFTs, mild cirrhosis) | IS metabolism impairment | Mild elevation acceptable; cirrhosis contraindication |

[Doc_27_Heart_Indications:chunk_003] 3.1 Cardiac and Hemodynamic Assessment
Tokens: 195
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Essential testing:

| Test | Purpose | Findings of Concern |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| Transthoracic echocardiography | Assess LVEF, RV function, valvular disease, PE | LVEF <20%; RV dysfunction |
| Cardiac catheterization | Hemodynamics (CO, CI, wedge, PVR) | Elevated filling pressures, low CI, elevated PVR |
| Right heart catheterization (RHC) | Measure PVR, transpulmonary gradient | PVR >3-4 mmHg/L concerning |
| Exercise stress test or CPX | Peak VO2, exercise tolerance | Peak VO2 <14 mL/kg/min indicates transplant benefit |
| Coronary angiography | Rule out significant CAD | Significant CAD = may preclude listing (surgically correctable lesions okay) |
| Cardiac MRI | Assess scar, infiltration, viability | Useful if echo indeterminate |

Hemodynamic parameters of interest:
Cardiac index (CI): <2.0 L/min/m² = severely depressed
Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP): >20 mmHg = elevated
Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR): <3 mmHg/L = ideal; >5 = concerning; >6-8 = contraindication
Transpulmonary gradient (TPG = mPAP - PCWP): <12 is best; <15 acceptable; >16 concerning

Reversibility of elevated PVR:
Trial inhaled pulmonary vasodilators (nitric oxide 20-40 ppm, epoprostenol)
If PVR drops significantly → may become candidate
If fixed → likely contraindication (RV failure risk)

[Doc_27_Heart_Indications:chunk_004] 5. SUMMARY AND KEY CONCEPTS
Tokens: 113
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Indications: Advanced HF refractory to medical therapy; peak VO2 <14 mL/kg/min ideal
2. LVEF <20%: Severe systolic dysfunction; primary indication
3. Inotrope-dependence: Strong indication; Status 1A priority
4. Mechanical support: Bridge to transplant; improves outcomes vs. medical therapy alone
5. Pulmonary hypertension: Major risk factor; must assess reversibility
6. RV function: Critical; elevated PVR or RV failure = contraindication
7. Renal function: eGFR >30 acceptable; <20 requires heart-kidney consideration
8. Psychosocial: Stable, motivated, adequate support required
9. Status system: 1A (most urgent) → 2 (stable symptomatic) → 3 (new listing)
10. LVEF <20% + NYHA III-IV refractory = transplant candidate
