[Doc_15_Kidney_Recurrent_GN:chunk_000] 1.1 Overall Incidence and Impact
Tokens: 172
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recurrent GN:
Incidence: 10-50% overall (varies by original disease type)
Timing: Usually >6 months post-transplant
Clinical significance: Causes 5-10% of graft loss by 10 years

De novo GN:
Incidence: 5-15% of allografts
Timing: Variable (early to late)
Mechanisms: Non-HLA antibodies, genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers

Risk factors for recurrence:

| Factor | Impact | Mechanism |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Original disease type | Varies dramatically | Some diseases >50% recurrence (IgA); others <5% |
| Time to ESRD | Rapid progression → higher recurrence | Shorter disease duration = less resolution |
| Age at transplant | Younger recipients → higher recurrence | More active immune response |
| Transplant timing | Early (eGFR >15) → higher risk | Less remission time; ongoing inflammation |
| Prior transplant loss to recurrence | Very high risk | Recurrence pattern likely to repeat |
| Disease remission status | Active disease → higher recurrence | Ongoing immune activation |
| Immunosuppression intensity | More intense IS reduces recurrence | More aggressive = less recurrence |

[Doc_15_Kidney_Recurrent_GN:chunk_001] 2.1 IgA Nephropathy (IgAN)
Tokens: 273
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epidemiology of original disease:
Most common primary GN worldwide
Progressive course; 40-50% progress to ESRD by 20 years

Recurrence in transplant:
Incidence: 40-50% (highest among common GN types)
Clinical recurrence (symptoms/proteinuria): 15-25%
Graft loss from recurrence: 5-10% by 10 years

Histologic recurrence:
Definition: IgA deposits on immunofluorescence in allograft kidney
May be asymptomatic (protocol biopsy detected) or symptomatic (hematuria, proteinuria)
IgA1-dominant deposits (similar to original disease)

Risk factors for recurrence:
Younger age at transplant (<30 years)
Rapid progression to original ESRD
Male gender
Asian ethnicity (possibly)
Prior transplant loss to IgAN

Clinical presentation of recurrent IgAN:
Hematuria (may be gross, usually microscopic)
Proteinuria (progressive; range 0.5-5+ g/day)
Rising creatinine (months-years of proteinuria; then decline)
Usually mild hypertension

Diagnosis:
Protocol biopsy: Best detection method (many asymptomatic recurrences)
Clinical presentation: Hematuria + proteinuria suspicious for recurrence
Electron microscopy: IgA deposits; waxy inclusions
Staging: Vary by severity (Haas classification or similar)

Management of recurrent IgAN:
Prevention of recurrence: Higher-intensity IS (some evidence; not absolute)
If early asymptomatic recurrence: Observe with proteinuria monitoring
If symptomatic or progressive proteinuria:
ACE inhibitor/ARB (RAS blockade; reduce proteinuria)
Intensive proteinuria reduction (<1 g/day target)
Blood pressure control
Possible steroid therapy (controversial; some use pulse methylprednisolone + oral steroids)
Fish oil (omega-3 fatty acids): Mixed evidence; some centers use empirically
CNI optimization (adequate levels)
Emerging therapies:
RAAS inhibition (ARB or ACE-I as above)
Mycophenolate at higher doses (uncertain benefit)
Rituximab (B-cell depletion): Limited data; anecdotal reports

Prognosis of recurrent IgAN:
Asymptomatic recurrence: Slow or no progression; may remain stable
Symptomatic recurrence: Progressive; median graft survival 15-20 years (vs. 20+ without recurrence)
Severe recurrence: May progress to graft failure in 5-10 years

[Doc_15_Kidney_Recurrent_GN:chunk_002] 2.2 Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)
Tokens: 315
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epidemiology:
Primary FSGS: 5-15% of primary GN; variable progression
Secondary FSGS: Obesity, hypertension, reflux

Recurrence in transplant:
Incidence: 30-50% (very high; concerning disease for retransplantation)
Circulating permeability factor: Thought to mediate recurrence (soluble factor in plasma)
Immediate recurrence: Can occur within hours-days post-transplant (proteinuria within 24-48 hours)
Graft loss from recurrence: 10-30% by 10 years

Pathogenesis of recurrence:
Circulating factor (likely immune-mediated) damages glomerular podocytes
Results in increased glomerular permeability
Proteinuria (nephrotic range typical) triggers sclerosis

Risk factors for recurrence:
Rapid progression of original disease (ESRD in <2 years) → very high risk
Young age at transplant
African American race
Prior transplant loss to FSGS (>50% recur in second graft)
Serum from recurrent recipient can cause proteinuria in culture systems (functional test)

Clinical presentation:
Heavy proteinuria (often nephrotic: >3.5 g/day) immediate post-transplant or early
May be accompanied by albuminuria, edema
Hematuria less common than in IgAN
Rising creatinine if severe proteinuria causes tubulointerstitial inflammation

Diagnosis:
Kidney biopsy: Gold standard; shows sclerotic lesions, foot process fusion on EM
Serum albumin: May be low if heavy proteinuria ongoing
Serum/urine protein: Quantify proteinuria

Management of recurrent FSGS:
Prevention: Higher-intensity IS (some evidence; not absolute)
Plasmapheresis: First-line for recurrence (removes circulating factor)
5-10 sessions; some patients respond dramatically (proteinuria resolution)
Infuse normal donor plasma or albumin
Efficacy: 30-50% have significant proteinuria reduction
Risk: Infections, other complications; limited benefit in some
Immunosuppression:
ACE inhibitor/ARB (reduce proteinuria)
Target high CNI levels (more aggressive than other diseases; aim 12-15 ng/mL)
Adequate MPA dosing
Consider additional agents if progressive despite above
Monoclonal antibodies:
Rituximab (B-cell depletion): Limited data; variable results
Abatacept (T-cell costimulation blockade): Emerging data; some reported successes
Symptomatic management:
Diuretics for edema
Lipid management (dyslipidemia common with proteinuria)
Blood pressure control

Prognosis:
With plasmapheresis + IS: 30-50% have remission of proteinuria
Progressive cases: Median graft survival 5-10 years from recurrence
Second transplant risk: Very high recurrence (>50%); careful consideration needed

[Doc_15_Kidney_Recurrent_GN:chunk_003] 2.3 Lupus Nephritis
Tokens: 189
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epidemiology:
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) affects 80% kidney; 10-20% progress to ESRD

Recurrence in transplant:
Incidence: Low (~5-10%) if original disease in remission
Very high risk: If transplant done while SLE active
Graft loss from recurrence: Rare (<2%)

Prerequisites for transplant in SLE:
Disease remission: Documented stable disease on therapies
Adequate immunosuppression: Ensure no SLE flare
Duration on dialysis: Often recommended to wait 6+ months to ensure remission

Risk factors for recurrent lupus nephritis:
Transplant during active SLE (major risk factor)
Non-adherence to immunosuppression
Suboptimal IS intensity
Female gender
Young age

Clinical presentation of recurrence:
Rising antibodies (anti-dsDNA, anti-C1q) often precede clinical recurrence
Hematuria, proteinuria
Rising creatinine
May be accompanied by systemic signs (rash, arthritis, serositis)

Management of recurrent lupus nephritis:
Prevent recurrence: Ensure SLE remission before transplant; use aggressive IS
Immunosuppression: High-intensity regimen recommended
Consider mycophenolate (may reduce SLE activity)
Adequate CNI levels
Hydroxychloroquine continuation (reduces SLE flares)
If recurrence occurs:
Rheumatology consultation
Increase IS intensity
Plasmapheresis for severe presentations
Pulse methylprednisolone if acute flare

Prognosis:
With adequate disease remission and IS: Good prognosis; recurrence rare
If recurrent: Can progress; but many remain stable with IS escalation

[Doc_15_Kidney_Recurrent_GN:chunk_004] 2.4 Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis (MPGN)
Tokens: 117
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MPGN type-related recurrence:

MPGN-C3 (C3 glomerulopathy):
Dense intramembranous deposits with dominant C3 on IF
Mediated by complement alternative pathway dysregulation
Recurrence: 40-50% (high)
Mechanism: Underlying genetic or acquired complement dysregulation persists

MPGN-immune complex (IC-MPGN):
Recurrence: 20-30%
Mechanisms vary by etiology (post-infectious, lupus, others)

MPGN-cryoglobulinemia (associated with HCV):
Recurrence: Rare if cryoglobulins cleared
HCV treatment with DAAs can improve outcomes

Clinical presentation:
Hematuria, proteinuria
Hypertension
Variable progression rates

Management:
Prevention: CAV control, hypertension management
ACE-I/ARB: Standard for all proteinuric GN
Complement inhibition (C3 glomerulonephritis): Emerging
Factor H replacement (eculizumab), Factor B inhibitors (pegcetacoplan)
Limited transplant data; more experience in native kidney

Prognosis:
Variable; depends on complement dysregulation severity
C3GN: 20-30% lose graft to recurrence by 10 years

Tokens: 118
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epidemiology:
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA)
Necrotizing GN; rapidly progressive without treatment

Recurrence in transplant:
Incidence: 5-15% (lower than other GN types)
Timing: Usually late (years post-transplant)
Risk with ANCA persistence: Higher recurrence if ANCA-positive at transplant

Prerequisites for transplant:
Disease remission: Achieved on induction therapy (cyclophosphamide, rituximab, or others)
ANCA status: Ideally negative or low-titer at transplant
Wait period: Some recommend 6+ months of remission

Management:
Induction therapy: Ensure complete remission before transplant
Maintenance: Consider rituximab maintenance (some protocols) vs. standard IS
Immunosuppression: Adequate CNI levels; consider mycophenolate or additional agents

Prognosis:
With disease remission at transplant: Good outcomes; recurrence uncommon
If recurrent: Can be severe; requires aggressive intervention

[Doc_15_Kidney_Recurrent_GN:chunk_006] 3.1 Clinical Approach
Tokens: 117
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Risk stratification:
Very high-risk diseases: FSGS (>40%), IgAN (40-50%), rapidly progressive GN
High-risk: MPGN (20-40%), MN (20-30%)
Moderate-risk: Lupus (5-10% if remission), AAV (5-15%)
Low-risk: Others

Monitoring strategy by risk:
Very high-risk: Earlier and more frequent biopsies; protocol biopsy at 1, 3, 5 years
High-risk: Protocol biopsy at 3-5 years; clinical monitoring annually
Moderate-risk: Clinical monitoring; biopsy if symptoms develop
Low-risk: Clinical monitoring; biopsy as indicated

Clinical surveillance:
Urinalysis/urine sediment: Monthly × 3, then quarterly × 1 year, then annually
Hematuria, proteinuria patterns may suggest recurrence
24-hour urine protein or UACR: Quarterly × 1 year, then every 6-12 months
Progressive increase concerning
Renal function: Monitor for decline
Serology: Disease-specific (anti-dsDNA for lupus, ANCA for vasculitis, etc.) ---

[Doc_15_Kidney_Recurrent_GN:chunk_007] 4. SUMMARY AND KEY CONCEPTS
Tokens: 104
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Recurrence risk varies widely: 40-50% IgAN, 30-50% FSGS vs. 5% lupus if remission

2. IgAN recurrence: Common but often asymptomatic; managed with proteinuria reduction and ACE-I/ARB

3. FSGS recurrence: Aggressive; requires plasmapheresis, high-intensity IS; high graft loss risk

4. Lupus nephritis: Low recurrence if SLE in remission at transplant; good outcomes expected

5. De novo GN: 5-15% incidence; membranous most common; slower progression typically

6. Monitoring strategy: Risk-stratified; protocol biopsies important for high-risk diseases

7. Management principles: RAS blockade universal (proteinuria reduction); disease-specific therapies as indicated
