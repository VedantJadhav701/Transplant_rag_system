Tokens: 153
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Absolute contraindications to donation:
Significant renal disease (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m²): Not donors
Diabetes mellitus (especially Type 1, poorly controlled): Relative; individualize
Significant hypertension (>140/90 mmHg uncontrolled): Requires control before clearance
Proteinuria (>300 mg/day or albuminuria >30 mg/g): Workup needed; reconsider if persistent
Hematuria (macroscopic): Urologic evaluation required
Active infection (UTI, other): Treat first
Malignancy: Depends on type/remission status; defer donation if active or recent
Significant cardiovascular disease: CAD, prior MI, cardiomyopathy: Individualize; optimize first
Liver disease: Depends on severity; cirrhosis contraindication
Thrombophilia or coagulopathy: Individualize; may increase operative bleeding risk
HIV/Hepatitis B/C: May donate to concordant recipient; requires informed consent/ID consultation

Relative contraindications (assess individually):
Age >60 years (vs. <50 years optimal; increased operative/long-term risk)
Obesity (BMI >35 kg/m²): Surgical complications increased; weight loss encouraged
Solitary kidney (congenital or prior nephrectomy): Contraindication
Uncontrolled psychiatric illness: Psychosocial clearance required
Active substance abuse: Reconsider; sobriety prerequisite
Significant socioeconomic hardship: Financial counseling; address barriers to recovery

[Doc_18_Kidney_Living_Donation:chunk_001] 1.3 Comprehensive Evaluation Components
Tokens: 450
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laboratory assessment:

| Test | Normal | Action if Abnormal |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| eGFR | >60 mL/min/1.73m² | eGFR 45-59: further evaluate; <45: reconsider |
| Creatinine | Normal age-appropriate | Abnormal: evaluate for renal disease |
| BUN | Normal | Abnormal: assess hydration, renal function |
| Electrolytes (Na, K, Cl, HCO3) | Normal | Abnormal: evaluate cause; correct pre-donation |
| Glucose (fasting) | <100 mg/dL | 100-125: impaired fasting glucose; >126: diabetes |
| Lipids | Desirable | Abnormal: discuss risk; not contraindication |
| Liver enzymes | Normal | Abnormal: evaluate; cirrhosis → contraindication |
| Coagulation (PT/INR, PTT) | Normal | Abnormal: evaluate for bleeding disorder |
| CBC | Normal | Anemia: evaluate; thrombocytopenia: assess |
| Urinalysis | Normal | Protein/RBC: 24-hr urine protein collection |
| 24-hr urine protein | <150 mg/day | >300 mg/day: reconsider; investigate proteinuria |
| Urine culture | Negative | Positive: treat UTI; reculture post-treatment |
| Blood pressure | <140/90 mmHg | >140/90: treat to goal; monitor pre-donation |

Serologic testing:

| Serology | Desirable | If Positive |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| HIV | Negative | Relative contraindication; specialized centers can proceed if recipient also HIV+ |
| HBsAg (HBV) | Negative | Relative; antiviral prophylaxis if donor+, recipient−; specialist consultation |
| Anti-HBc, anti-HBs | Immune or vaccinated | Not contraindication; assess immunity |
| Anti-HCV (HCV) | Negative | Relative; RNA viral load; coordinate with ID; direct-acting antivirals available |
| RPR/TPPA (syphilis) | Negative | Treat if positive; neurosyphilis workup if symptomatic |
| Strongyloides serology | Negative | Treat if positive (ivermectin) before donation |
| TB (IGRA or TST) | Negative | If positive: rule out active TB; treat LTBI if needed |
| CMV serology | Variable | Not contraindication; donor CMV status noted for recipient management |
| EBV serology | Variable | Not contraindication; noted for recipient (especially if recipient EBV-negative) |

Imaging studies:
Ultrasound of kidneys: Assess size, echogenicity, hydronephrosis, masses
Should be: Normal size (9-13 cm), normal echogenicity, no hydronephrosis
Abnormal: Cysts (if simple <2-3 cm acceptable; complex concerning), atrophy, stones, tumors → contraindication
Renal artery duplex (Doppler) ultrasound or CT angiography:
Essential to assess vascular anatomy
Identify: Single artery (easiest surgery) vs. multiple arteries (more complex but not contraindication)
Stenosis: Rule out significant renal artery stenosis
Aneurysm: Rare; if found, vascular surgery consultation
ECG and chest X-ray: Baseline; indicated if cardiovascular risk factors

Cardiovascular evaluation (risk-stratified):
Low risk (age <50, no CAD risk factors): ECG and chest X-ray
Intermediate risk (age 50-70 or cardiac risk factors): Stress test (treadmill, pharmacologic, or imaging)
High risk (age >70, prior CAD, multiple risk factors): Coronary angiography or CTA

[Doc_18_Kidney_Living_Donation:chunk_002] 1.4 Psychosocial Evaluation
Tokens: 216
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mandatory psychosocial assessment by independent team (separate from transplant surgical/medical team):

Components:

| Area | Assessment | Goal |
|------|-----------|------|
| Motivation | Why donate? Understand reasons | Altruistic motivation; not coerced |
| Relationship | Dynamics with recipient | Appropriate boundary; relationship healthy |
| Mental health | History of psychiatric illness, current status | Stable; under treatment if needed; no contraindications |
| Coping skills | How handle stress, problem-solve | Adequate; support systems identified |
| Understanding | Comprehend risks, benefits, alternatives | Informed; realistic expectations |
| Autonomy | Free to decide; no coercion | Independent choice; time to decide |
| Support system | Family, social support post-surgery | Adequate support for recovery |
| Financial barriers | Can afford to miss work, travel to appointments? | Address barriers; financial counseling if needed |
| Health literacy | Understand medical information? | Education provided; verified comprehension |

Red flags requiring caution:
Donor under pressure from family/recipient
Donor doesn't understand risks
Donor has unrealistic expectations ("cure" recipient)
Donor has active psychiatric illness (untreated)
Donor has history of substance abuse (not in stable recovery)
Financial desperation motivating decision (organ trafficking concern)

Psychological support:
Counseling before surgery (address anxiety, expectations)
Support groups (connect with other donors)
Post-operative counseling (process any grief, regret, etc.) ---

[Doc_18_Kidney_Living_Donation:chunk_003] 2.1 Core Elements
Tokens: 194
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Informed consent must include (legally/ethically):

1. Purpose: Explain kidney donation, transplantation, how it helps recipient
2. Risks (surgical and medical):
Operative mortality: ~1 per 10,000 (0.01%) for open nephrectomy; <0.01% for laparoscopic
Major morbidity: Infection (1-5%), bleeding (1-2%), hematoma (5-10%), DVT/PE (0.5-1%)
Pain/discomfort: Post-operative pain for weeks; occasionally chronic pain (0.5-1%)
Wound complications: Infection, dehiscence, hernia (2-5%)
Anesthesia risks: Aspiration, cardiac, respiratory complications (rare; ~0.1%)

3. Long-term renal health:
GFR decline: ~25% initial decline; then slow decline (similar to general population aging)
Hypertension: 50% develop HTN (vs. 40% general population); multifactorial; not solely from donation
Proteinuria: Rare; monitor if occurs
ESRD risk: Estimated 1 in 200 donors over lifetime (vs. 1 in 3000 general population)
Higher risk: Pre-existing HTN, DM, obesity, African American race, age >60 at donation
Pregnancy: Slightly increased preeclampsia risk (2-3×); otherwise safe

4. Alternatives:
Recipient continues dialysis
Recipient waits for deceased donor
Recipient pursues desensitization/paired exchange (if incompatible)

5. Right to withdraw:
Donor can change mind at ANY time before surgery
No penalty; relationship should not be affected
Can decline surgery day-of without explanation

6. Confidentiality and privacy:
Medical information kept confidential
Donation status private (share only if donor chooses)

[Doc_18_Kidney_Living_Donation:chunk_004] 3.1 Graft Survival
Tokens: 100
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outcomes superior to deceased donation:

| Outcome | Living Donor | Deceased Donor | Difference |
|---------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| 1-year graft survival | 98% | 95% | +3% |
| 5-year graft survival | 90-95% | 85% | +5-10% |
| 10-year graft survival | 80-90% | 70-75% | +10-15% |
| Median graft survival (half-life) | 18-20 years | 12-15 years | +5-8 years |

Reasons for superior outcomes:
Shorter cold ischemia time (planned surgery; minimal ischemia)
Better HLA matching (especially related donors)
Healthier donor organs (living donors screened; no brain death injury)
Recipient better prepared (planned surgery; optimization possible)

[Doc_18_Kidney_Living_Donation:chunk_005] 4.1 Traditional Paired Exchange
Tokens: 146
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mechanism:
Donor-recipient pair A: Donor incompatible with their recipient (usually ABO or HLA)
Donor-recipient pair B: Donor incompatible with their recipient
Exchange: Donor A's kidney → Recipient B; Donor B's kidney → Recipient A
Both recipients now compatible; both transplants proceed

Example (ABO-incompatible pairs):
Pair A: Type O donor (wants to give to Type B recipient - incompatible)
Pair B: Type B donor (wants to give to Type O recipient - incompatible)
Exchange: O kidney → Type O recipient (Pair B); B kidney → Type B recipient (Pair A)

Immunologic workup:
ABO compatibility verified
HLA matching assessed (virtual crossmatch)
DSA tested (crossmatch negative required)
Careful typing/testing to ensure true compatibility after exchange

Logistics:
Coordinated operative scheduling (same operating rooms, same day if possible)
If Donor A has complication, Donor B's surgery can be cancelled (recipient priority)
Legal contracts specifying terms (what happens if donor unavailable, etc.)

[Doc_18_Kidney_Living_Donation:chunk_006] 7. SUMMARY AND KEY CONCEPTS
Tokens: 106
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Living donation superior outcomes: 5-10-year graft survival advantage vs. deceased donation

2. Comprehensive evaluation mandatory: Medical, serologic, imaging, psychological assessment

3. Informed consent critical: Detailed risk discussion, autonomy protection, right to withdraw

4. Independent psychosocial evaluation: Separate from surgical team; ensures true autonomy

5. Paired kidney exchange: Expands access for incompatible pairs; excellent outcomes

6. Altruistic donation: Growing; requires enhanced psychosocial screening; enables chains

7. Long-term donor health: HTN development 50%; ESRD risk 1 in 200 (individualized)

8. Ethical protections: NOTA prohibition on organ sales; autonomy, fairness principles upheld
