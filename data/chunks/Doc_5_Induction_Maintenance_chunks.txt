================================================================================

[Doc_5_Induction_Maintenance:chunk_000] 1.1 Factors Influencing Regimen Choice
Tokens: 180
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Immunologic Risk Factors:
Low risk: First transplant, living donor, HLA-matched, no prior sensitization (PRA 0%), no DSA
Moderate risk: First deceased donor transplant, some HLA mismatch, low PRA (<20%), no DSA
High risk: HLA mismatch (3-4+ antigen mismatches), high PRA (>50%), pre-existing DSA, prior transplant, African American race

Organ-Specific Factors:
Kidney: Most liberal use of immunosuppression (can tolerate CMV prophylaxis, etc.) Liver: Relative immunologic privilege; lower immunosuppression often sufficient
Heart/Lung: High rejection risk; require intensive immunosuppression
Pancreas: Similar to kidney; intermediate risk
Intestine: Highest rejection risk; most intensive immunosuppression

Recipient-Specific Factors:
Renal function: GFR < 30 mL/min → avoid CNI, consider CNI-sparing
Age: Older recipients may tolerate less intense IS; may need adjusted dosing
Comorbidities: Diabetes, hypertension, CVD influence drug choice
Adherence: High-risk non-adherent recipients → simpler regimens (once-daily dosing preferred)
Infection history: CMV seropositivity, prior BK virus, tuberculosis exposure → specific monitoring/prophylaxis

Donor Factors:
Extended criteria donor (ECD): Older donor, prolonged cold ischemia → may warrant more intensive IS
Living donor: Planned surgery; more elective; potential for preoperative conditioning
Deceased donor: Unpredictable cold ischemia; may warrant more aggressive induction

[Doc_5_Induction_Maintenance:chunk_001] 2.2 Depleting Induction Agents
Tokens: 342
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Rabbit Anti-Thymocyte Globulin (rATG)

Mechanism: Polyclonal antiserum causing T-lymphocyte depletion (apoptosis, CDC, ADCC)

Dosing Protocols:

Protocol A: Standard 7-10 day course (most common)
Dose: 1.25 mg/kg IV daily × 7-10 days
Timing: Start day 0-1 post-operative
Target: Achieve T-cell depletion (CD4+ <50/μL, CD8+ <50/μL) by day 3-5

Protocol B: Extended 14-day course (high-risk)
Dose: 1.25 mg/kg IV daily × 14 days
Indication: Highest-risk recipients (sensitized, high HLA mismatch)
Goal: More profound/sustained depletion

Protocol C: Shorter 3-5 day course (lower-risk)
Dose: 1.25 mg/kg IV daily × 3-5 days
Indication: Low-risk, living donor, living related donor
Goal: Adequate T-cell depletion with less toxicity

Monitoring during rATG:
CD4+/CD8+ counts: Track daily or every other day; target <100/μL
CBC: Platelet count, WBC (may develop thrombocytopenia, neutropenia)
Viral: CMV antigen; EBV PCR at baseline

Efficacy:
Reduces acute rejection: 5-8% with rATG vs. 20-30% without
Reduces dnDSA: Some benefit vs. non-depleting induction
Reduces chronic rejection: Possible benefit (long-term data limited)

Adverse Effects Management:

| Adverse Effect | Prevention/Management |
|---|---|
| Infusion reactions | Premedicate with acetaminophen 650-1000 mg, diphenhydramine 25-50 mg, IV methylprednisolone 125 mg before dose |
| Fever/chills | Anti-fever agents; slower infusion rate |
| Thrombocytopenia | Monitor CBC; platelet transfusions if <20,000 |
| Neutropenia | Monitor CBC; reduce dose or defer if ANC <1,000 |
| Serum sickness (day 10-14) | NSAIDs, antihistamines, additional corticosteroids |
| PTLD risk | EBV monitoring; consider shorter course in EBV-negative recipients |

#### Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H)

Mechanism: Humanized monoclonal antibody against CD52; lymphocyte depletion

Dosing:
Single-dose protocol: 0.3-0.5 mg/kg IV on day 0-1 (total 20-30 mg for adult)
Two-dose protocol: 0.3 mg/kg on day 0, repeated day 4 (total 40-60 mg)
Extended protocol: Less common; 20 mg IV × 5 days

Advantages:
Faster infusion (1-2 hours vs. 4-6 hours for rATG)
Fewer infusion reactions (humanized)
Outpatient feasible
Rapid T-cell depletion

Disadvantages:
Profound B-cell depletion (may be disadvantage)
More sustained lymphopenia
Cost (more expensive than rATG)
Faster T-cell recovery (may increase later rejection risk in some studies)

Efficacy: Comparable to rATG; acute rejection prevention similar

Tokens: 148
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Basiliximab (Simulect)

Mechanism: Chimeric antibody against IL-2 receptor (CD25); blocks IL-2 signaling without T-cell depletion

Dosing:
Adult: 20 mg IV on day 0, day 4 (or day 1, day 5)
Pediatric <35 kg: 10 mg per dose

Administration:
IV bolus or infusion over 20-30 minutes
Well tolerated; minimal premedication needed

Advantages:
Well tolerated; minimal infusion reactions
No systemic lymphopenia (T cells inactive but present)
No increased PTLD risk
Better for recipients with infection concerns
Can safely give to EBV-negative recipients

Disadvantages:
Less potent: 10-15% acute rejection (vs. 5-8% with depleting agents)
Limited effect on chronic rejection
Limited impact on dnDSA prevention
Cost (expensive)

Clinical Use:
Standard induction in many low-risk, living-donor programs
Preferred in recipients with chronic infections, immunodeficiency concerns
Less suitable for high-HLA mismatch, sensitized recipients

Efficacy:
Reduces acute rejection from 40%+ to 10-15%
Better safety profile than depleting agents
Trade-off: Less acute rejection prevention

[Doc_5_Induction_Maintenance:chunk_004] 3.1 Standard Triple-Drug Regimen
Tokens: 653
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The modern standard maintenance regimen combines three drug classes targeting different immune pathways:

#### Component 1: Calcineurin Inhibitor (CNI)

Choice between tacrolimus and cyclosporine:

| Characteristic | Tacrolimus | Cyclosporine |
|---|---|---|
| Potency | More potent | Less potent |
| Dose | Lower | Higher |
| Oral bioavailability | 7-20% | 20-50% |
| Predictability | More predictable | Highly variable |
| Nephrotoxicity | Similar | Similar |
| Hypertension | Moderate | Severe (50-80%) |
| Gingival hyperplasia | Rare | Common (20-50%) |
| Hirsutism | Rare | Common |
| PTDM | 15-25% (high) | 5-10% |
| Drug interactions | Moderate (CYP3A4) | Many (CYP3A4, others) |
| Cost | Cheaper (generic) | More expensive |
| Current use | Standard (90%+) | Declining (5-10%) |

Tacrolimus dosing and targeting:

| Time Post-Tx | Initial Dose | Target Trough | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Day 0-3 | 0.1-0.15 mg/kg BID | 10-15 ng/mL | Intense IS; high rejection risk |
| Week 1-4 | Adjusted per TDM | 10-12 ng/mL | Maintain potency; risk balancing |
| Month 2-6 | Adjusted per TDM | 8-10 ng/mL | Lower doses as rejection risk declines |
| Month 6-12 | Adjusted per TDM | 5-8 ng/mL | Maintenance; minimize toxicity |
| Year 2+ | Adjusted per TDM | 4-6 ng/mL (kidney); 8-10 ng/mL (other organs) | Long-term; focus on minimizing CNI toxicity |

Therapeutic drug monitoring:
Measure trough level (C0; just before next dose)
Timing: Assess 3-5 days after dose change (steady state)
Frequency: Daily × 3-5 days post-transplant, then every 2-3 days × 2 weeks, weekly × 1 month, then every 1-2 weeks × 3 months, then monthly
Method: HPLC, LC-MS/MS, or immunoassay (results may differ between methods)

#### Component 2: Antimetabolite

Choice between Mycophenolic Acid (MPA) and Azathioprine (AZA):

| Characteristic | MPA (MMF/EC-MPA) | Azathioprine |
|---|---|---|
| Potency | More potent | Less potent |
| Efficacy | Better outcomes vs. AZA | Inferior outcomes |
| GI toxicity | Common (15-30%) | Similar (20-30%) |
| Bone marrow suppression | Less | More |
| Cost | Expensive | Cheap |
| Teratogenicity | Category X (absolute contraindication pregnancy) | Category B (relatively safe in pregnancy) |
| Current use | Standard (>90%) | Declining |

MPA dosing:

| Agent | Dose | BID vs. QID |
|---|---|---|
| Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) | 500-1500 mg BID (1-3 g/day) | BID (or QID if better tolerated) |
| Enteric-coated MPA (EC-MPA, Myfortic) | 360-720 mg BID | BID |

Dosing modifications:
Start: 1 g (500 mg MMF) or 720 mg (EC-MPA) BID post-transplant
Escalate: Increase to 1.5 g BID (1500 mg MMF) or higher as tolerated
Target: Maximum tolerated dose (usually 1-1.5 g BID) associated with better outcomes
Reduce: If GI toxicity; attempt dose reduction before discontinuation

Monitoring:
No established therapeutic level monitoring (TDM)
Clinical response: Rejection prevention, graft function
CBC: Monitor for neutropenia (target ANC >2,000/μL; discontinue if <1,000)
LFTs: Baseline

#### Component 3: Corticosteroid

Dosing and taper:

| Period | Drug/Dose | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Operative | Methylprednisolone 500-1000 mg IV × 1 dose | Perioperative anti-inflammatory |
| POD#1-3 | Methylprednisolone 500-1000 mg IV daily × 3 days | Induction effect |
| Week 1 | Prednisolone 40-60 mg daily | Transition to PO; high IS |
| Week 2-4 | Prednisolone: Taper 40→30→20→10 mg daily | Gradual reduction |
| Month 1-6 | Prednisolone 7.5-10 mg daily | Maintenance |
| Month 6+ | Prednisolone 5-7.5 mg daily (or discontinue) | Long-term maintenance or withdrawal |

Steroid minimization vs. withdrawal:
Minimization: Taper to lowest effective dose (2.5-7.5 mg daily)
Safer than withdrawal
Reduces adverse effects
Required additional IS
Withdrawal: Complete discontinuation after weeks-months
Suitable for low-risk recipients only
Requires excellent other IS
Higher acute rejection risk
Not recommended: High HLA mismatch, DSA, African American, prior rejection

[Doc_5_Induction_Maintenance:chunk_006] 3.3 CNI-Sparing Regimens
Tokens: 202
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reducing CNI exposure is attractive to minimize nephrotoxicity. Several approaches:

#### Belatacept-Based Regimen

| Component | Dose |
|---|---|
| Belatacept (costimulation blockade) | 10 mg/kg IV day 0, day 4, week 2, week 4; then 5 mg/kg monthly |
| Reduced-dose Tacrolimus | Target trough 4-6 ng/mL (vs. 8-10 with CNI-based) |
| MPA | 1-1.5 g BID |
| Prednisolone | 5-7.5 mg daily |

Advantages:
Better renal function preservation
No hyperglycemia (vs. tacrolimus)
Less hypertension
BENEFIT trial: 7-year GFR 48 mL/min (vs. 35 mL/min cyclosporine)

Disadvantages:
IV infusion required (monthly)
PTLD risk (~2-4% vs. ~1% CNI-based)
EBV monitoring essential
Cost

#### mTOR Inhibitor-Based CNI-Sparing Regimen

| Component | Dose |
|---|---|
| Sirolimus OR Everolimus | Sirolimus: 2-3 mg daily (target trough 5-8 ng/mL) |
| Very low-dose Tacrolimus | Target trough 2-3 ng/mL (minimal CNI) |
| MPA | 1-1.5 g BID |
| Prednisolone | 5-7.5 mg daily |

Advantages:
Reduced CNI nephrotoxicity
Anti-proliferative effect
Anti-fibrotic potential

Disadvantages:
Delayed wound healing (problematic perioperatively)
Impaired renal recovery (especially with DGF)
Dyslipidemia
GI toxicity (diarrhea, stomatitis)
Requires careful monitoring (target levels)
Limited long-term data on outcomes

Timing: Usually introduced at month 3+ post-transplant (after wound healing, renal recovery)

[Doc_5_Induction_Maintenance:chunk_007] 4.3 Year 1+ (Long-Term Maintenance)
Tokens: 106
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Goals:
Maintain stable graft function
Prevent dnDSA development
Prevent chronic rejection
Minimize medication side effects

Monitoring:
TDM: Every 3-6 months (stable recipients may taper to every 6 months)
Clinic visits: Every 2-3 months
Labs: Every 3 months (creatinine, electrolytes, CBC, LFTs)
Viral monitoring: Every 3-6 months (CMV antigen)
DSA testing: Every 6-12 months (early detection of dnDSA)
Annual imaging (ultrasound for kidney transplants; annually for first 2 years)

Long-term adjustments:
Further reduction in CNI levels (target 3-5 ng/mL for kidney; higher for other organs)
Steroid minimization (target 2.5-5 mg daily or discontinuation)
Consider belatacept conversion (some centers; data limited)
Address comorbidities aggressively (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes)

[Doc_5_Induction_Maintenance:chunk_008] 6. SUMMARY AND KEY CONCEPTS
Tokens: 166
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Induction immunosuppression prevents acute rejection in the highest-risk period (days 1-14)
Depleting agents (rATG, alemtuzumab): More potent; ~5-8% AR
Non-depleting (basiliximab): Less potent; ~10-15% AR; better tolerated

2. Maintenance regimen balances IS intensity against toxicity over lifetime
Standard triple therapy: CNI (tacrolimus) + antimetabolite (MPA) + corticosteroid
Individualized based on immunologic risk, organ type, renal function

3. Calcineurin inhibitors remain cornerstone but require therapeutic drug monitoring
Tacrolimus preferred (more potent, fewer interactions than cyclosporine)
Target levels decrease over time post-transplant

4. Antimetabolites required for adequate suppression
MPA superior to azathioprine; standard in modern regimens
Dose escalation to max tolerated dose associated with better outcomes

5. Corticosteroids difficult to withdraw despite toxicity
Minimization to 2.5-7.5 mg daily reasonable
Complete withdrawal suitable only for low-risk recipients

6. CNI-sparing approaches reduce nephrotoxicity
Belatacept: Renal-sparing; PTLD concern
mTOR inhibitors: Anti-proliferative; impairs renal recovery early

7. Emerging biomarkers guide personalized IS adjustments
dd-cfDNA, GEP, DSA trends inform therapy
