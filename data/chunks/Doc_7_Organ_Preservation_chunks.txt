[Doc_7_Organ_Preservation:chunk_000] 1.1 Mechanisms of Ischemic Injury
Tokens: 283
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Energy Depletion

Normal aerobic metabolism:
Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation generates ATP
Maintains ion gradients (Na+/K+ ATPase), cellular function
Continuous: ~1-2 ATP molecules regenerated per glucose

During ischemia (anaerobic conditions):
Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation ceases (no O2)
ATP production drops to ~2% of basal level (from anaerobic glycolysis alone)
ATP depletion within minutes (brain cells: 3-5 min; kidney/liver cells: 15-30 min)
Na+/K+ ATPase fails → cellular swelling (cytotoxic edema)
Calcium homeostasis lost → intracellular Ca2+ accumulation

Consequences:
Endothelial cell dysfunction (loss of NO production, increased permeability)
Epithelial cell injury (tubular epithelium in kidney; hepatocytes in liver)
Smooth muscle cell dysfunction
Myocardial stunning (cardiac cells)
Increased expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin)

#### Intracellular Calcium Overload

Mechanism:
ATP depletion → Na+/K+ ATPase failure → intracellular Na+ accumulation
Na+ accumulation activates Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (reversed direction) → intracellular Ca2+ accumulation
Also: Direct activation of Ca2+ channels during ischemia

Consequences of Ca2+ overload:
Activation of calpains and caspases (proteolytic enzymes) → protein degradation
Activation of phospholipase A2 → membrane lipid degradation → loss of membrane integrity
Mitochondrial damage (Ca2+ uptake → mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS production)
Activation of apoptotic pathways

#### Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Generation

During ischemia:
Mitochondrial function impaired → incomplete electron transport → ROS generation (superoxide, hydroxyl radical)
Xanthine oxidase activation (from ATP catabolism to adenosine → inosine → hypoxanthine → xanthine; xanthine oxidase generates ROS)

During early reperfusion (most critical):
Reintroduction of oxygen
Incomplete electron transport chains (still recovering) generate massive ROS
Iron-catalyzed reactions (Fenton reaction) → hydroxyl radical generation
Neutrophil infiltration → NADPH oxidase-derived ROS
Peak ROS generation: First 15-30 minutes of reperfusion

Consequences of ROS:
Lipid peroxidation → membrane damage
Protein oxidation → loss of enzyme function
DNA damage → apoptosis
Mitochondrial dysfunction

[Doc_7_Organ_Preservation:chunk_001] 1.2 Reperfusion Injury and Inflammation
Tokens: 101
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Immediate reperfusion response (minutes):
Reactive oxygen species burst (see above)
Endothelial cell activation (upregulation of adhesion molecules, TF)
Thrombosis (tissue factor expression, platelet aggregation)
Complement activation (C3a, C5a generation; classical pathway from IgM on damaged endothelium)

Early inflammatory phase (hours):
Neutrophil infiltration (recruited by C5a, chemokines)
Macrophage infiltration
Production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8)
Increased vascular permeability → edema
Increased endothelial dysfunction

Consequences:
Graft edema (especially problematic in lung, brain)
Microvascular thrombosis
Delayed graft function (DGF) in kidney
Primary graft dysfunction in liver
Primary graft failure (PGF) in heart
Early bronchial artery injury in lung → airway complications

[Doc_7_Organ_Preservation:chunk_002] 2.2 Cold Preservation Solutions
Tokens: 189
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Historical solutions:
Normal saline: Minimal organ preservation; acceptable only <2-3 hours

Modern solutions (intracellular-type formulations):
University of Wisconsin (UW) solution: Gold standard for many organs
Components: Impermeants (lactobionic acid, raffinose), colloids (hydroxyethyl starch), antioxidants (allopurinol, glutathione)
pH ~7.4, osmolality 320 mOsm/kg
Composition mimics intracellular fluid (high K+, low Na+)
Mechanism: Prevents cell swelling (impermeants retain water outside cell); reduces ROS (antioxidants)
Use: Kidney, liver, pancreas, intestine (not ideal for heart, lung)
HTK (Histidine-Tryptophan-Ketoglutarate) solution (Custodiol):
Components: Histidine (buffer), tryptophan (membrane stabilization), ketoglutarate (metabolism)
Formulation: Extracellular-type (low K+)
Use: Especially heart, lung (good for hypoxic organs)
Mechanism: Membrane stabilization; reduced reperfusion injury
Comparable outcomes to UW for kidney/liver in some studies
Newer solutions: Organ-specific optimizations
Subnormothermic perfusate: Warmed solutions preserving organs at 20-30°C (better than 4°C for some organs)
Oxygen-supplemented solutions: Reduce hypoxic injury during preservation

Solution composition principles:
Impermeants: Lactobionic acid, raffinose, mannitol → prevent water entry into cells during cold → reduce edema
Colloids: Hydroxyethyl starch, albumin → maintain oncotic pressure
Antioxidants: Allopurinol, glutathione, ascorbate, deferoxamine → scavenge ROS
Buffers: Bicarbonate, HEPES, phosphate → maintain pH
Electrolytes: Variable K+/Na+ ratio depending on formulation
Glucose/substrates: Fuel for residual metabolism

[Doc_7_Organ_Preservation:chunk_003] 2.3 SCS Protocol
Tokens: 118
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Donor organ procurement:
1. In situ flush: Aortic cannulation; cold preservation solution infused through aorta
Flush rapidly cools organ
Removes blood, RBCs (reduce IRI)
Vena cava/portal vein vented to decompress organ
Typical volume: 50-100 mL/kg over 5-10 minutes

2. Explantation and back-table: Careful dissection; further flushing on sterile field

3. Transport: Organ placed in sterile bag → cold saline → outer insulated cooler with ice

Acceptable cold ischemia times:
Kidney: 24-36 hours (preferred <12 hours)
Liver: 12-15 hours (preferred <8 hours)
Heart: <4 hours (rarely tolerated >6 hours; 4 hours is practical limit)
Lung: <6-8 hours
Pancreas: <12-15 hours

Temperature maintenance:
Goal: Keep organ ≤8°C (ideally 1-4°C)
Monitor: Temperature tags in cooler
Transport time minimized (race against clock)

[Doc_7_Organ_Preservation:chunk_004] 3.1 Hypothermic Machine Perfusion (HMP)
Tokens: 234
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Overview

Definition: Active perfusion of organ with oxygenated cold solution (typically 4-10°C)

Mechanism of benefit over SCS:
Oxygen delivery: Continuous oxygenation (dissolved O2 in cold solution)
Partially restores aerobic metabolism
Reduces lactate accumulation (marker of anaerobic metabolism)
Reduces ROS generation (hypoxia-reperfusion injury prevented)
Flushing: Continuous perfusion removes cellular debris, potassium accumulated during ischemia, coagulation factors
Clearance: Lactate, hydrogen ions continuously removed
Metabolic support: Glucose, substrates available; ATP levels partially restored
Functional assessment: Flow rate, resistance, organ response can be monitored

#### HOPE (Hypothermic Oxygenated Perfusion)

Specific machine perfusion technique:
Organ connected to proprietary perfusion circuit
Cold (4-10°C), oxygenated solution (FiO2 100%) continuously recirculated
Pump maintains pressure and flow
Solution warmed to maintain temperature
Duration: Until transplantation (hours to days in some protocols)

Evidence for HOPE in kidney transplantation:
Prospective randomized trials show benefit vs. SCS:
Reduced DGF: 20-25% (HOPE) vs. 30-40% (SCS)
Better 1-year graft function: Higher GFR with HOPE
Reduced rejection: Some studies show lower rejection rates

Evidence for HOPE in liver transplantation:
HOPE reduces ischemic cholangiopathy (ITBL) in extended criteria donor livers
HOPE outcomes: 10-15% ITBL incidence vs. 20-30% (SCS) in ECD livers
Better liver function recovery
Enables use of longer cold ischemia time (15-20 hours) with preservation of outcomes

Cost and practical considerations:
Expensive equipment ($200,000-500,000 initial cost)
Ongoing consumable costs (disposable circuits, solutions)
Requires trained personnel
Time-intensive (setup, monitoring, transport with equipment)
Currently not widely available (limited centers)

[Doc_7_Organ_Preservation:chunk_005] 3.2 Normothermic Machine Perfusion (NMP)
Tokens: 198
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Overview

Definition: Active perfusion of organ with warm (37°C), oxygenated, blood-based solution

Mechanism of benefit:
Restoration of aerobic metabolism: Normothermic temperature restores full metabolic rate
ATP regeneration: Complete restoration possible (vs. partial in HMP)
Functional assessment: Organ working at physiologic temperature; function assessable
Reversal of injury: Potential to reverse some ischemic injury through metabolic support
Longer preservation window: Potential for extended preservation (days) if perfusion maintained

Key difference from HMP:
Hypothermic perfusion: Slows but doesn't eliminate ischemia; extends time window
Normothermic perfusion: Restores organ function; potential for "organ reconditioning"

#### Normothermic Kidney Perfusion (NKP)

Technique:
Kidney connected to portable perfusion circuit
Warm (37°C), oxygenated solution (blood-based) perfuses via renal artery
Continuous monitoring: Flow, oxygen consumption, creatinine clearance, urine output
Duration: Variable (hours to days)

Clinical data (emerging):
Pilot studies show:
Better recovery of renal function vs. SCS
Ability to assess viability (oxygen consumption, urine output indicate viable kidney)
Potential to extend preservation window (preservation for 24+ hours with maintained function)
Possible reversal of delayed graft function risk

Challenges:
Equipment cost (expensive; $500,000+)
Complexity: Requires trained technician, continuous monitoring
Transport: Equipment portable but cumbersome
Solution preparation: Blood-based solution required
Current status: Investigational; not standard of care yet

[Doc_7_Organ_Preservation:chunk_006] 7. SUMMARY AND KEY CONCEPTS
Tokens: 131
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Ischemia-reperfusion injury is major cause of graft dysfunction; energy depletion, ROS, inflammation primary mechanisms

2. Static cold storage (SCS) remains standard; inexpensive, simple, effective for short ischemia times (<4-12 hours depending on organ)

3. Machine perfusion (HMP, NMP) emerging; enables functional assessment, extends ischemia tolerance, reduces DGF
HOPE: Proven benefit in kidney, liver (reduces DGF, ITBL)
NMP: Promising but investigational; may enable extended preservation

4. Ischemia time limits organ-specific:
Heart: <4 hours (major constraint on geographic sharing)
Lung: <6-8 hours
Liver: <12-15 hours
Kidney: <24-36 hours

5. Emerging technologies (EVLP, NMP, organ engineering) may dramatically expand donor pool and outcomes

6. Cost-benefit: MP technologies expensive; cost-benefit greatest for marginal (ECD, DCD) donors where benefit most pronounced
