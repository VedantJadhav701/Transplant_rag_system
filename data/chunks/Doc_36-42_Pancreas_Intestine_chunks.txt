Indications:
SPK (simultaneous pancreas-kidney): Type 1 DM + ESRD; most common (80% of pancreas transplants)
1-year graft survival: kidney ~95%, pancreas ~88%
5-year graft survival: kidney ~85%, pancreas ~70%
Outcomes excellent; kidney improves with pancreas function
PAK (pancreas-after-kidney): Type 1 DM; prior kidney transplant success
1-year graft survival: ~85%
Less common (~15% of pancreas transplants)
PTA (pancreas transplant alone): Type 1 DM; no renal disease
Rare (~5% of pancreas transplants)
Reserved for:
Brittle diabetes (severe hypoglycemic unawareness, recurrent DKA)
Hypoglycemic episodes despite CGMS
Significant quality-of-life impairment
 
Candidate selection (Type 1 DM criteria):
Duration of diabetes typically >20 years
HbA1c <7% despite maximal IS therapy (some protocols)
C-peptide negative/low (confirms Type 1)
Age <50-60 years (some centers older)
No significant CAD (stress test/angiography if risk factors)
Adequate renal function (for SPK/PAK)
Motivation for lifelong IS + frequent monitoring

Absolute contraindications:
Type 2 diabetes (high recurrence)
Uncontrolled psychiatric illness
Active substance abuse
Severe CAD unsuitable for surgery
Severe hepatic/renal disease (other than DM-related)
Malignancy (recent/active)

Benefits of pancreas transplant vs. insulin:
Euglycemia (normal blood glucose without exogenous insulin)
Improved renal function (if SPK; kidney graft protected from hyperglycemia)
Prevention of DM complications (retinopathy progression slows; some reversal possible)
Quality of life improvement (freedom from insulin injections, glucose monitoring)
Improved cardiovascular outcomes (some studies suggest benefit)
Lifespan improvement (debated; some studies show longevity benefit)

Donor evaluation:
Age <50 preferred; >60 marginal
BMI <30 ideal; >35 concerning
No diabetes (obvious exclusion)
No pancreatic disease (pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis)
AST/ALT normal
Hemodynamically stable
No extended ischemia (organ very sensitive to warm ischemia)

Donor procurement:
In situ flush: Aortic cannulation; cold UW solution infused through SMA + celiac axis
Vascular dissection: Careful; preserve all vessels (proper hepatic artery, SMA, portal vein, splenic vein)
Whole pancreas: Usually entire pancreas + duodenum (attached) transplanted
Segmental pancreas: Distal pancreas only (rare; higher thrombosis risk)

Cold preservation:
Solution: UW (University of Wisconsin) preferred
Temperature: 0-4°C
Ischemia time: Goal <12 hours; >24 hours significantly increases dysfunction

Pancreas transplant surgical technique:
Vascular anastomoses:
Arterial: Graft superior mesenteric + splenic arteries anastomosed to recipient (usually aorta or iliac artery; Y-graft commonly used)
Venous: Graft portal vein anastomosed to recipient (usually iliac vein)
Exocrine drainage (choice between 2 methods):
 1. Bladder drainage (classic): Duodenum anastomosed to recipient bladder
Advantage: Easy biopsy if rejection (cystoscopic approach); technical ease
Disadvantage: Metabolic acidosis from urinary bicarbonate loss; chronic cystitis; UTI risk
Complication: Duodenitis from urine irritation
 
 2. Enteric drainage (increasingly preferred): Duodenum anastomosed to jejunal loop (Roux-en-Y)
Advantage: Physiologic; avoids urinary complications
Disadvantage: Biopsy requires laparoscopy/open surgery (more invasive)
Complication: Pancreatitis, fistula (less common than bladder complications)

Site of transplant:
Usually right lower abdomen (iliac fossa)
Sometimes left lower abdomen if right unsuitable

Early complications (first weeks-months):

Vascular thrombosis (most common; 5-10%):
Arterial thrombosis: More common than venous
Presentation: Sudden elevation of glucose + amylase + lipase; graft pain
Diagnosis: Doppler ultrasound (no flow); CT angiography
Risk factors: Hypercoagulability, small vessels, young donor, prolonged ischemia
Management: Urgent thrombectomy if within hours; otherwise graft loss inevitable
Prevention: Aspirin ± other anticoagulation (protocols vary)

Pancreatitis:
Incidence: 5-15% (self-limited) to 1-5% (severe, graft-losing)
Etiology: Ischemic injury, reperfusion injury, handling during procurement
Presentation: Elevated amylase/lipase; abdominal pain
Diagnosis: CT, lipase elevation
Management: Conservative (NPO, fluids); rarely necrotizing
Prevention: Gentle handling, minimal ischemia time, appropriate preservation

Anastomotic leak/fistula (2-5%):
Location: Vascular or enteric anastomosis
Presentation: Fever, abdominal pain, peritonitis; drainage fluid from drain
Diagnosis: Imaging, drain analysis
Management: Surgical repair if salvageable; otherwise graft loss
Prevention: Meticulous technique

Bleeding (10-15%; often self-limited):
Source: Anastomotic, vascular, pancreatic parenchyma
Management: Most resolve without intervention; some require re-exploration

Acute rejection (20-30% incidence):
Diagnosis: Biopsy (if bladder-drained, cystoscopic duodenal biopsy; if enteric-drained, ultrasound-guided)
Management: Pulse steroids ± rATG
Grading: Similar Banff classification as kidney
Usually reversible with treatment

Immunosuppression post-pancreas:
Induction: Often more intense than kidney (rATG vs. basiliximab)
Maintenance: Triple therapy (CNI, antimetabolite, steroid)
Target levels: Often higher than kidney alone (concern for graft loss)

Outcomes by transplant type:

SPK (simultaneous pancreas-kidney):
1-year patient survival: 95-98%
1-year kidney graft survival: 95-98%
1-year pancreas graft survival: 88-92%
5-year patient survival: 80-85%
5-year kidney graft survival: 85-90%
5-year pancreas graft survival: 70-75%
10-year pancreas graft survival: 50-60% (median half-life ~15-17 years)

1-year pancreas graft survival: 85-90%
5-year: 65-70%
Slightly worse than SPK (pre-existing kidney disease management)

PTA (pancreas transplant alone):
Rarer; similar outcomes to PAK
Less common due to complications/limited indications

Causes of graft loss:
Chronic rejection: 40-50%
Recurrent autoimmunity: 10-20% (attack on new pancreas; rare but possible)
Thrombosis: ~5%
Infection: ~3-5%
Other (technical, non-compliance): ~10%

Quality-of-life outcomes:
Euglycemia achieved (average glucose 100-120 mg/dL)
Insulin independence: 85-95% at 5 years
Hypoglycemic episodes essentially eliminated
Improved general well-being, freedom from injections
Reduced fear of complications

Bladder vs. enteric drainage outcomes:
Bladder drainage: Higher acute rejection rates (~35% vs. ~25%); metabolic acidosis in 40%
Enteric drainage: Fewer complications long-term; increasingly preferred
Trend: Conversion to enteric drainage if bladder complications develop

Indications for intestine transplant:
Intestinal failure: Loss of absorptive capacity requiring TPN indefinitely
Specific conditions:
Short bowel syndrome (surgical resection, Crohn's disease, trauma)
Pseudo-obstruction (chronic; irreversible)
Congenital disorders (microvillus inclusion disease, intestinal aganglionosis)
Familial polyposis with prophylactic colectomy
Motility disorders (severe; refractory to medical therapy)

TPN failure criteria (indication for transplant):
Recurrent sepsis from central line infections
Loss of vascular access (thrombosis)
Progressive hepatic disease from TPN (TPN-induced liver disease)
Poor quality of life (permanent hospital dependence)
Desire for independent nutrition (quality-of-life indication)

Candidate selection (very strict):
Age: Wide range (pediatric to adult; depends on specific indication)
Motivation: Must understand high complication rate
Good social support: Essential (lifelong intensive management)
Absence of severe comorbidities: Surgical risk must be acceptable
Psychiatric stability: Stress of chronic complications
No active sepsis at time of transplant (absolute contraindication)

Absolute contraindications:
Malignancy (any active/recent)
Active infection (especially fungal)
Severe liver dysfunction (liver often involved in TPN complications)
Psychiatric instability
Lack of social support

Outcomes:
1-year patient survival: 85-90%
5-year patient survival: 60-70%
1-year graft survival: 75-85%
5-year graft survival: 50-60%
Most common cause of failure: Chronic rejection (50%)
Acute rejection: 70-80% incidence (very high; most immunogenic organ)

Transplant types:
Isolated intestine: Small bowel only (simplest)
Multivisceral: Intestine + liver + stomach ± pancreas (complex; sometimes necessary if multiple organs damaged)

Quality of life post-transplant:
Independence from TPN (major benefit)
Ability to eat orally (psychologically important)
But significant morbidity from rejection, complications
Not curative (median 5-7 years of graft function)

Heart-lung transplant:
Indications: Eisenmenger syndrome (uncorrectable), PPH, CF with cor pulmonale, complex congenital disease
Outcomes: 5-year ~50-60% (similar to individual heart/lung but worse when combined)
Allocation: High priority (Status 1A)
Complications: Combined heart + lung rejection/complications

Kidney-heart transplant:
Rare; indicated for ESRD + advanced CAD unsuitable for CABG
Very few centers perform
Outcomes: Limited data; challenging

Kidney-liver transplant:
Indicated: ESRD + hepatic cirrhosis (HCV end-stage, autoimmune, others)
Special consideration: Liver provides some immune tolerance benefit to kidney
Outcomes: Better than expected (kidney benefits from liver)

Pancreas-liver transplant:
Rare; Type 1 DM + liver disease
Liver protects pancreas from some rejection

Small bowel with other organs (multivisceral):
Intestine + liver ± pancreas ± spleen
Highest complexity
Outcomes: Poor (but necessary if multiple organs diseased)

Pediatric pancreas/intestine transplants:
Increasingly performed (improved outcomes with modern IS)
Challenge: Growth (child grows; graft may become relatively small)
Challenge: Long-term adherence (years of IS + monitoring)
Intestine in pediatric: Often done for short-bowel syndrome from surgical complications
Outcomes: Reasonable with experienced centers

Living donor pancreas (distal pancreas):
Emerging; limited centers perform
Distal pancreas removed; proximal remnant left in donor
Donor risks: Pancreatitis, endocrine dysfunction
Recipient benefits: Planned surgery, better HLA match possible
Still rare; insufficient long-term data

Re-transplantation (pancreas):
Possible if first graft fails
Second graft outcomes worse than first (sensitization, prior surgery)
Usually reserved for motivated candidates

Xenotransplantation (pancreas):
Genetically modified pig pancreas research ongoing
Potential future option if animal organ can reliably function
FDA approval of pig heart (2023) suggests FDA openness
Still experimental; no clinical pancreas xenotransplants yet

Immunological tolerance strategies:
Induction of tolerance to pancreas could eliminate need for lifelong IS
Chimerism (mixed immune system) being explored
Could revolutionize outcomes if successful
