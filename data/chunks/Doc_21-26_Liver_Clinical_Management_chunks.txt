Early graft assessment: INR trends, liver enzymes, bile quality
Hemodynamic management: Fluid optimization, vasoactive support
Immunosuppression initiation: Induction agents, CNI dosing, drug interactions
Infection prevention: CMV prophylaxis (D+R−), PCP, fungal, bacterial
Early complication diagnosis & management:
Primary graft dysfunction (PGD): Definition, treatment, outcomes
Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT): <2% incidence; ischemic necrosis of bile duct
Portal vein thrombosis: Rare; usually graft-losing
Bile leak: 1-2%; managed by ERCP ± stenting + drain
Hemorrhage: 5-10% require re-exploration
Acute rejection: 15-20% incidence; steroid-responsive
Coagulopathy management: Fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, platelets
Nutritional support: Early enteral nutrition preferred
Drain management: Output, character, timing of removal

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Epidemiology: 15-20% incidence; peaks week 1-4 post-transplant
Risk factors: HLA mismatch, non-adherence, lower CNI levels
Clinical presentation: Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP), elevated bilirubin, fever (uncommon)
Diagnostic approach:
Liver biopsy: Gold standard; shows portal inflammation, bile duct damage, endothelial inflammation
Banff classification: Grade 0-3 based on severity
Biopsy necessary: Distinguish rejection from other causes (CMV, drug toxicity, PVT, others)
Management:
Corticosteroid pulse: 500-1000 mg IV methylprednisolone daily × 3-5 days
Success rate: 70-80% respond to steroids
rATG: For steroid-resistant (1.25 mg/kg × 7-14 days)
Rituximab: B-cell depletion; limited liver rejection data vs. kidney
CNI optimization: Ensure therapeutic levels (not sub-therapeutic)
No need to reduce CNI: Unlike some rejection management; maintain or increase levels
Prognosis:
Steroid-responsive rejection: Good outcomes; graft function recovers
Steroid-resistant: Worse prognosis; higher mortality but salvageable
Late rejection: Unusual in liver; if occurs, consider non-adherence

Chronic rejection: Uncommon (<5%); characterized by ductopenia, foam cell arteriopathy
Progressive fibrosis over years
Similar to chronic kidney rejection but lower incidence
Management: CNI optimization, maintain adequate IS
Recurrent hepatitis C (HCV):
Incidence: Universal (100%) in HCV+ recipients without treatment
Progression: Variable (10-30% develop cirrhosis by 5 years; some stable)
Outcomes: HCV recurrence reduces graft survival vs. HCV− recipients
Management: Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy
Timing: Usually wait 3-6 months post-transplant (allow immune stabilization)
Efficacy: >95% sustained virologic response (SVR)
Benefits: Improved graft survival when HCV cured
Immunosuppression interactions: Minimal with newer DAAs
Recurrent hepatitis B (HBV):
Prevention: HBIG (hepatitis B immunoglobulin) indefinitely + antivirals (entecavir, tenofovir)
Incidence with prophylaxis: <5% reinfection
Without prophylaxis: 75-80% reinfection
Management if reinfection: Enhance antivirals, consider lamivudine, adefovir resistance monitoring
Other viral recurrences:
HEV (hepatitis E): Chronic infection possible in immunosuppressed; difficult to treat
CMV: Hepatitis rare; prophylaxis prevents
Disease progression factors:
Age (older = faster progression)
Degree of immunosuppression (lower IS = faster progression)
Adherence (non-adherence = faster progression)
Co-infections (HBV/HCV co-infection = very aggressive)
Alcoholic liver disease recurrence: Alcohol use resumption leads to graft loss

HBV/HCV co-infection epidemiology:
5-10% of HCV+ patients also HBV+
Higher in PWID (people who inject drugs), regions with endemic HBV
Accelerated liver fibrosis with co-infection
HBV/HCV co-infected donor policy:
Previously contraindication
Now: Acceptable to HBV/HCV co-infected recipient with antiviral coverage
Requires: Hepatology/ID specialist consultation
Recipient management (HBV/HCV co-infected):
HBV prophylaxis: HBIG + antivirals (entecavir or tenofovir)
HCV treatment: DAAs after transplant (typically 3-6 months wait)
Drug interactions: Monitor between IS and antivirals
Outcomes: Improved significantly with DAA therapy
Sequential treatment approach:
Stabilize transplant first (3-6 months)
Then initiate HCV DAA therapy
Monitor closely for interactions, hepatotoxicity
Special populations:
HIV-positive co-infected: Additional complexity; IS/ART interactions
Renal dysfunction: Adjust DAA dosing if eGFR <30

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) of allograft:
Definition: Fibrosis/stricturing of bile ducts (donor or native)
Incidence: 1-15% (higher in ECD, DCD, longer ischemia)
Pathogenesis: Ischemic injury to bile duct epithelium
Progressive: Can lead to graft cirrhosis
Risk factors for ITBL:
DCD donation (highest risk; 15%+)
Extended criteria donor (older, higher transaminases)
Long cold ischemia time (>12 hours significantly increases)
Donor age >70
Elevated AST/ALT pre-transplant
Negative: Liver biopsy steatosis not independently protective
Clinical presentation:
Often asymptomatic (found on surveillance imaging)
Elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
Cholangitis (if stricture severe)
Progressive graft dysfunction
Diagnosis:
Imaging: Ultrasound (dilated ducts) → MRCP (gold standard; shows strictures)
Laboratory: Elevated ALP, GGT; elevated bilirubin if obstruction
Biopsy: Shows fibrosis, duct loss (ductopenia)
Management:
Early (single stricture): ERCP with sphincterotomy ± stent (can delay/prevent progression)
Progressive: Options limited; retransplantation if severe
Medical: No proven preventive therapy (ursodeoxycholic acid ineffective)
Surgical: Transplantectomy if severe with liver failure
Prevention:
Minimize cold ischemia time
Machine perfusion (HOPE) reduces risk in ECD (emerging evidence)
Careful matching of ECD kidneys with lower-MELD recipients (less risk tolerance)

Outcomes by etiology:
HCV: Historical poor outcomes; now excellent with DAAs
ALD: 5-year survival 80%; recurrence 10-20%
HBV: Excellent (>80% at 5 years) with HBIG + antivirals
HCC: 70-80% at 5 years within Milan criteria
Cholestasis (PBC, PSC): Excellent (>80-85% at 5 years)
Autoimmune: Very good (>85% at 5 years)
Survival analysis:
Patient survival: 1-year ~88%, 5-year ~75%, 10-year ~60%
Graft survival: 1-year ~85%, 5-year ~70%, 10-year ~50%
Median half-life: ~12-15 years (deceased); 20+ years (living)
Death with functioning graft: 50% of "graft losses" = death, not graft failure
MELD-based allocation equity:
Sickest-first principle: Reduces mortality on waiting list
HCC exceptions: Controversial; some argue prioritizes less-sick patients over sicker non-HCC
Geographic variation: Some regions longer waits than others
Policy evolution: Continuous review to balance utility + equity
Special populations:
Elderly (>65 years): Generally good candidates; outcomes reasonable
Pediatric: Excellent outcomes (>90% at 5 years); ABO-incompatible increasing
Re-transplantation: Worse outcomes (graft half-life ~8 years vs. ~12-15 first transplant)
Hepatocellular carcinoma: Expanding criteria beyond Milan; longer waits
Living donor: Excellent outcomes; planned surgery advantage; can select lower-MELD recipients
Quality metrics:
Graft survival vs. center: Large variation; volume matters (high-volume centers better)
Donor-recipient matching: Better matching = better outcomes
Immunosuppression protocol: Modern triple therapy superior to older regimens
