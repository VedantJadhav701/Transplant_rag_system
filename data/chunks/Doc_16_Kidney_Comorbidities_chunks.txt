--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multiple mechanisms contributing:

| Mechanism | Details | Prevalence |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Native kidney HTN | Pre-transplant HTN persistence (not from graft) | Very common |
| Calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) effect | Vasoconstriction, sodium retention, RAS activation | ~30-40% of transplant HTN |
| Corticosteroid effect | Sodium retention, sympathetic activation | ~10-20% |
| Renal artery stenosis | Allograft artery narrowing (1-5% incidence) | <5% of HTN |
| Allograft rejection | Inflammatory state increases BP | ~10% |
| Recurrent native kidney disease | If native kidneys still present | Variable |
| Obesity | Post-transplant weight gain | Common contributor |
| Reduced graft mass | Single kidney physiology; increased Na reabsorption | Contributing factor |

Blood pressure targets:
KDIGO recommendation: <120/80 mmHg (more intensive control for cardioprotection)
Individualized: Some older/frail recipients target <130/80 acceptable
Avoid overly aggressive: Risk of acute kidney injury if over-treated

Antihypertensive agents:

| Agent | Advantages | Disadvantages | Use |
|-------|-----------|---------------|-----|
| ACE inhibitor | Renoprotective (↓ proteinuria); CV protective | Hyperkalemia risk; cough in some; contraindication if pre-transplant renal disease | First-line |
| ARB (Angiotensin receptor blocker) | Renoprotective; no cough; similar efficacy to ACEi | Hyperkalemia risk | First-line (alternative to ACEi) |
| Calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) | Well tolerated; no metabolic effects | Gingival hyperplasia; edema; avoid diltiazem/verapamil (CNI interaction) | Second-line |
| Beta-blocker (carvedilol, metoprolol) | CV protective; indicated if CAD/HF | Fatigue, weight gain, metabolic effects | Use if indicated (CAD, HF) |
| Thiazide diuretic | Simple, cheap | Metabolic effects (hypokalemia, glucose); hyperuricemia | Avoid if possible; use if volume overload |
| Loop diuretic | Volume depletion if overloaded | Hypokalemia; electrolyte abnormality | Only if volume overload |

Drug interactions with CNI:
Avoid: Diltiazem, verapamil (↑ CNI levels)
Use carefully: NSAIDs (↓ GFR); reduce ACEi/ARB early post-op
Monitor: Amlodipine does NOT significantly interact; safe choice

BP monitoring:
Frequency: Every clinic visit (monthly first year, then every 3-6 months)
Home BP monitoring: Encouraged if possible (detects "white coat" vs. true HTN)
Goal: <130/80 mmHg (or individualized per guidelines)

Non-pharmacologic management:
Sodium restriction: <2.3 g/day (reduces BP, proteinuria)
Weight management: Maintain healthy BMI (obesity worsens HTN)
Exercise: Regular physical activity (150 min/week moderate)
DASH diet: Proven BP reduction
Stress reduction: Meditation, relaxation techniques
Avoid NSAIDs: Worsen HTN, reduce GFR
Limit alcohol: <2 drinks/day

Management if HTN refractory:
1. Assess adherence: Blood work shows CNI level therapeutic? 2. Assess volume status: Volume overloaded (needs diuretic)? 3. Renal artery stenosis screening: Doppler ultrasound if suspected
4. CNI reduction: Consider lowering target level (if elevated)
5. Medication optimization: Maximize current agents before adding more
6. Specialist consultation: Nephrology/cardiology if refractory

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Screening:
Fasting glucose: Baseline, then every 3-6 months year 1, then annually
HbA1c: Every 6-12 months (reflects 3-month average)
Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): If fasting glucose borderline (100-125 mg/dL)

Diagnosis:
Fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL: Diabetes
HbA1c ≥6.5%: Diabetes
OGTT 2-hour glucose ≥200 mg/dL: Diabetes
Impaired fasting glucose: 100-125 mg/dL; increased diabetes risk

Prevention:
Lifestyle modification: Weight management, exercise, diet (critical)
CNI selection: Tacrolimus > cyclosporine (if possible/early decision; usually already on tacrolimus)
Minimization of corticosteroids: Taper to ≤5 mg/day prednisolone
Sirolimus avoidance: If PTDM risk (use other agents if possible)
Weight management: Peri-operative period critical (prevent excessive weight gain)

Treatment if PTDM develops:

| Agent | Class | Dose | Considerations |
|-------|-------|------|----------------|
| Metformin | Biguanide | 500-2000 mg/day | First-line; avoid if eGFR <30; monitor renal function |
| SGLT2 inhibitor | New agent | Variable | Graft-protective in some studies; emerging use |
| GLP-1 agonist | Incretin | Varies | Weight loss benefit; CV protection |
| DPP-4 inhibitor | Incretin | Varies | Well-tolerated; modest HbA1c reduction |
| Sulfonylurea | Secretagogue | Varies | Hypoglycemia risk; less preferred |
| Insulin | Hormone | Variable | May require if advanced DM or high glucose needs |

Glycemic targets:
General: HbA1c <7.5% (less stringent than non-transplant; balance hypoglycemia risk)
Older/frail: HbA1c <8% acceptable
Young/new-onset: HbA1c <7% reasonable target

Monitoring:
Glycemia: Home glucose monitoring if on insulin or high diabetes risk
HbA1c: Every 3-6 months if DM; adjust therapy based on trend
Lipids: Lipid panel every 6-12 months (dyslipidemia common with DM)
Kidney function: eGFR, proteinuria (DM accelerates CKD)
Annual eye exam: Diabetic retinopathy screening
Annual foot exam: Diabetic neuropathy screening

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Screening:
Lipid panel: Baseline, then every 3-12 months depending on values
Components: Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides

Goals (KDIGO-based):
LDL cholesterol: <100 mg/dL (or <70 if high CV risk)
Total cholesterol: <200 mg/dL (ideal)
Triglycerides: <150 mg/dL
HDL: >40 mg/dL (men), >50 mg/dL (women)

Non-pharmacologic management:
Dietary modification:
Low saturated fat (<7% of calories)
High fiber (10-25 g/day)
Plant sterols/stanols (2 g/day)
Limit simple carbohydrates
Weight management: 5-10% weight loss significantly improves lipids
Exercise: 150 min/week moderate aerobic activity
Avoid smoking: Cessation critical for CV health

Pharmacologic management:

| Agent | Type | Dose | Target | Notes |
|-------|------|------|--------|-------|
| Atorvastatin | Statin | 10-80 mg daily | LDL <100 | First-line; adjust dose for CNI interaction |
| Rosuvastatin | Statin | 5-40 mg daily | LDL <100 | Less CNI interaction than atorvastatin |
| Pravastatin | Statin | 20-40 mg daily | LDL <100 | Less CNI interaction; less potent |
| Ezetimibe | Cholesterol absorption inhibitor | 10 mg daily | Adjunct to statin | Add if LDL not at goal |
| Fibrate (fenofibrate) | Triglyceride-lowering | 145 mg daily | Triglycerides <150 | Use if high triglycerides; monitor creatinine |
| Omega-3 (fish oil) | Natural | 2-4 g/day | Triglycerides | Variable efficacy; well-tolerated |
| PCSK9 inhibitor | Very potent LDL-lowering | Variable | LDL <70 (high risk) | Expensive; reserve for statin-intolerant or very high risk |

Statin considerations:
Drug interactions: Statins metabolized via CYP3A4 (same as CNI); monitor levels, adjust if needed
Muscle symptoms: Myalgia/myositis possible; monitor for weakness, pain
CK elevation: Check CK if muscle symptoms; discontinue if markedly elevated
Universally recommended: All transplant recipients should be on statin (cardiometabolic benefit even with normal lipids)

Monitoring:
Lipid panel: Every 3-6 months initially; then annually if stable on therapy
Liver enzymes: Baseline; repeat if dose escalation; generally well-tolerated
Muscle symptoms: Ask at each visit; CK only if symptomatic
