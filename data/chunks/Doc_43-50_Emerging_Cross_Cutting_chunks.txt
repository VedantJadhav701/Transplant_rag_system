Genetic modifications preventing rejection:
PERV (porcine endogenous retroviruses): Deleted from donor pigs
Alpha-gal: Pig cell surface antigen recognized as foreign; knocked out
Human transgenes: HCAD, MICA knocked down; human complement regulators (CD55, CD46, CD59) added
Coagulation modulation: Human thrombomodulin added (prevents thrombotic microangiopathy)
FDA-approved pig heart xenotransplant (2023):
Recipient: David Bennett (terminal cardiac failure; not candidate for human heart; on LVAD)
Outcome: 2 months survival; death from porcine virus (porcine CMV) infection
Lesson: Need better viral prophylaxis; immunosuppression adequate
Technical success: Surgery successful; mechanical function good
Current clinical experience:
Limited (only handful of FDA cases)
Outcomes improving with each case
Immunosuppression protocols being refined
Barriers to widespread adoption:
Immunologic: Hyperacute rejection overcome; acute/chronic still challenges
Infectious: Porcine viruses; risk of zoonotic transmission to recipients/contacts
Technical: Graft sizing (pig organs smaller than adult human)
Ethical: Public acceptance; consent for novel therapy
Regulatory: FDA oversight; informed consent burden
Future potential:
Pig lungs, kidneys, liver next candidates
Could solve organ shortage (unlimited supply)
Economics: Potentially cheaper than human deceased organs
Timeline: 10-15 years for widespread adoption (if barriers overcome)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tolerance mechanisms:
Deletional tolerance: T-cell clones recognizing graft deleted (central tolerance)
Regulatory tolerance: Regulatory T cells (Tregs) suppressing graft-reactive cells
Immune deviation: Shift from Th1 (rejection) to Th2/Treg (acceptance)
Linked suppression: Tolerance to one antigen providing bystander tolerance
Experimental tolerance induction strategies:
Chimerism: Mixed hematopoietic stem cell transplant + organ transplant
Goal: Donor bone marrow engrafts; mixed immune system
Result: Graft perceived as "self"
Challenge: GVHD risk; achieving stable chimerism difficult
Early success in kidney (small trials)
Co-stimulation blockade (CTLA4-Ig, anti-CD40L):
Block T-cell activation signals (costimulation)
May allow induction of Tregs
Limited success; usually requires additional IS
Belatacept (CTLA4-Ig) approved for maintenance (not tolerance induction)
Regulatory T cell (Treg) expansion:
Expand recipient Tregs in vitro
Infuse back (cell therapy)
Could suppress rejection without systemic IS
Early trial data promising but limited
Whole organ transplant immunomodulation:
Tissue engineering: Modify organ pre-transplant to reduce immunogenicity
ex vivo perfusion: Deliver tolerance-inducing agents during preservation
Human trials (early):
Kidney transplant chimerism trial (Stanford): Some tolerance achieved; but long-term data limited
ATACO trial (co-stimulation blockade + kidney): Reduced IS possible in some
Multiple small trials: Showing proof-of-principle; not yet clinical standard
Timeline to clinical adoption:
Optimistic: 5-10 years for first approved tolerance protocols
Realistic: 15-20 years before widespread adoption
Barriers: Reproducibility, long-term safety data, complex cellular therapies

Machine perfusion (MP) principles:
Organ perfused with preservation solution while outside body
Reduces ischemic injury vs. static cold storage
Allows assessment of organ quality
Enables therapeutic interventions during preservation
Hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE):
Temperature: 4°C (hypothermia reduces metabolism)
Oxygenation: Organ receives oxygen; maintains aerobic metabolism partially
Pressure: Low pressure (avoids edema)
Benefits: Reduces ischemic cholangiopathy in ECD livers
Evidence: Multiple RCTs show benefit in liver transplant
Current use: Increasingly standard in liver centers for ECD organs
Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP):
Lung perfused with solution at controlled temperature; ventilated
Preserves lung function: Allows assessment of initially poor-quality lungs
Potential recovery: Some marginal lungs "recover" function on EVLP
Extended preservation: Enables 12-18 hour ischemia (vs. 6-8 hours with cold storage)
Expanding donor pool: Can use organs previously declined (low PaO2/FiO2)
Current status: Used by increasing number of lung centers
Normothermic perfusion:
Temperature: 37°C (warm; similar to in vivo)
Allows organ function assessment during preservation
Potential for organ conditioning (therapeutic interventions)
Limitations: Complex; expensive; not yet standard
Future potential: Could enable kidney conditioning, optimization
Kidney machine perfusion:
Less established than liver/lung
HOPE being explored for kidney
Benefits: Extended preservation (>48 hours possible)
Reduces ischemic injury vs. cold storage
Economics & logistics:
MP devices expensive (capital + operating costs)
Requires trained personnel
Justified by expanding usable donor pool
Increasingly cost-effective as technology matures

Unique pediatric considerations:
Growth: Corticosteroids impair linear growth; minimize steroids
Organ size: Small children receive smaller organs; growth may exceed organ capacity
Drug metabolism: Metabolic rates higher in children; often require higher mg/kg IS doses
Absorption: Oral IS absorption variable; monitor levels closely
Psychosocial: Developing cognitive/emotional; adherence challenges adolescence
School/social: Normalize life; avoid isolation; mainstreaming important
Immunosuppression in pediatrics:
Induction: Similar agents as adults; dose by weight
Maintenance: Higher CNI/antimetabolite doses often needed (faster metabolism)
Steroid minimization: Critical for growth; taper aggressively
Target IS levels: May be higher than adults (pediatric immune response more vigorous)
Graft outcomes (pediatric vs. adult):
Kidney: Pediatric recipients have longer graft half-life (21 years vs. 15 years adult)
Liver: Excellent outcomes (>90% at 5 years); better than adult
Heart: Excellent (>90% at 5 years)
Overall: Pediatric recipients achieve best outcomes (younger immune system, better adaptation)
Specific issues by organ:
Kidney: Growth consideration; need appropriate-sized allograft
Liver: Technical (small hepatic vessels); increasingly successful
Heart: Excellent outcomes; cardiomyopathy main indication
Lung: Rarer; CF main indication
Pancreas: SPK increasingly performed in pediatric
Transition to adult care (age 16-21):
Critical period; rejection risk increases during transition
Structured program essential (overlap pediatric + adult providers)
Psychosocial support during transition
Adherence monitoring intensified
Quality of life:
Most pediatric recipients attend school, participate in sports
Seizure medications required but manageable
Normal development with appropriate support
Excellent long-term outcomes

Benefits of transplant vs. dialysis in elderly:
Better outcomes even at age >80 (vs. continued dialysis)
Quality of life improvement (less time on dialysis)
Cost-effectiveness: Despite shorter life expectancy, still cost-effective
Survival: 5-year ~70-80% (depends on comorbidities)
Evaluation modifications for elderly:
Cardiovascular: Stress testing recommended even without symptoms
Cognitive: Assess decision-making capacity
Functional: Frailty assessment important (predicts perioperative risk)
Comorbidities: Optimize manageable conditions
Physiologic age: Look past chronologic age
Immunosuppression in elderly:
Standard IS generally well-tolerated
CNI dosing: May need lower target levels (reduce nephrotoxicity in setting of reduced renal reserve)
Steroid dose: Lower maintenance doses acceptable
Drug interactions: Multiple comorbidity medications; monitor interactions
Adherence: Support systems important (pillboxes, reminders)
Special considerations by organ:
Kidney: Excellent outcomes in carefully selected elderly
Liver: Acceptable in good-risk elderly; some age-related increased complications
Heart: Surgical risk higher; outcomes reasonable if physiologically fit
Lung: Highest risk; careful selection essential
Pancreas: Less common in elderly; when done, similar success to younger
Perioperative management:
Epidural anesthesia: Often preferred (vs. general)
Careful fluid management: Less physiologic reserve
Early mobilization: Prevent delirium, complications
Extended monitoring: ICU observation often extended
Long-term outcomes:
Death with functioning graft: More common in elderly than younger (expected)
Return to dialysis: ~50-60% graft losses due to death, not graft failure
Graft survival: Slightly lower than younger recipients (comorbidities)
Overall excellent outcomes: Appropriate selection yields very good results

Female recipients - pregnancy planning:
Timing: Wait 12+ months post-transplant (allow graft stabilization)
Stability criteria: Stable graft function (creatinine <1.5 mg/dL), no recent rejection
Drug optimization:
Safe IS drugs: Prednisone, azathioprine, CNI (tacrolimus, cyclosporine), mycophenolate mofetil
Avoid: Mycophenolic acid direct (teratogenic; requires conversion to MMF pre-conception)
Uncertain safety: Sirolimus (limited data)
IS adjustments during pregnancy:
CNI levels may decline (increased metabolism); increase monitoring
Often need dose increases to maintain therapeutic levels
Frequent TDM (therapeutic drug monitoring) required (monthly or more)
Graft outcomes during pregnancy:
Most pregnancies result in live births
Graft function usually maintained
Slight increased rejection risk during pregnancy (immune activation)
Close monitoring essential (creatinine, proteinuria, BP)
Maternal complications:
Preeclampsia: 20-30% incidence (2-3× general population)
Hypertension: Exacerbation common
Gestational diabetes: Risk increased
Polyhydramnios, polyuria: Common (mild; self-limited)
Neonatal outcomes:
Generally healthy
Birth weight slightly lower than general population (average ~200 grams less)
IS drug exposure generally safe (minimal placental transfer most drugs)
Breastfeeding: Generally safe with standard IS (IS drugs in breast milk minimal)
Male recipients - reproductive health:
Fertility issues (pre-transplant consequences):
Uremia/dialysis often causes hypogonadism
Sexual dysfunction (fatigue, anemia, depression)
Post-transplant improvements:
Testosterone levels often normalize
Sexual function usually improves
Fertility often restored
IS effects on male fertility:
CNI may reduce spermatogenesis (reversible)
Mycophenolate: Teratogenic; avoid if planning fatherhood
Overall: Most IS drugs have minimal impact on male fertility
Assisted reproduction:
IVF increasingly used post-transplant
Success rates reasonable (similar to non-transplant)
Requires coordination with transplant team (IS adjustments)

Indications for retransplantation:
Graft failure from: Chronic rejection, recurrent disease, thrombosis, other
Return to dialysis undesirable (mortality higher; diminished quality of life)
Motivation and fitness for repeat surgery
Sensitization after first transplant:
HLA antibodies: Develop in ~90% of recipients at graft failure
De novo DSA: New antibodies to donor HLA antigens
CPRA (calculated percent reactive antibodies): May increase significantly
Challenge: Finding compatible donor increasingly difficult (higher cPRA = fewer compatible)
Desensitization for retransplant:
Plasmapheresis + IVIG + rituximab: Similar to initial desensitization
Goal: Lower DSA titers; allow transplant despite some HLA incompatibility
Success rate: ~70-80% achieve adequate desensitization
Outcomes: Retransplant with reduced DSA titers → lower rejection rates
Donor selection for retransplant:
HLA matching: Attempt to match; if no match available, proceed with desensitization
Crossmatch: Negative crossmatch required (or desensitized if positive)
Wait time: Often longer (sensitized; fewer compatible donors)
Outcomes comparison (retransplant vs. first transplant):

| Measure | First Transplant | Retransplant | Difference |
|---------|------------------|-------------|-----------|
| 1-year kidney graft survival | 96% | 92% | −4% |
| 5-year kidney graft survival | 85-90% | 75-80% | −10% |
| 1-year rejection rate | 10-20% | 25-35% | +15% |
| Chronic rejection incidence | 30-50% | 50-70% | +20% |
| Median graft half-life | 12-15 years | 8-10 years | −4 years |
Special considerations:
Multiple retransplants: Each retransplant carries worse prognosis
Psychological: Grief from prior loss; hope for success; depression risk high
Social support: Essential given higher stress
