[Doc_8_Infection:chunk_000] 1.1 Timing of Infection Post-Transplant
Tokens: 179
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Post-transplant infections follow predictable temporal patterns based on degree of immunosuppression:

0-1 month (Immediate period):
Infections common in non-transplant surgery: Surgical site infections, line infections, aspiration pneumonia
Sources: Donor-transmitted (from contaminated organs), operatively acquired
Organisms: Bacterial (S. aureus, Streptococcus, Gram-negatives), fungal (Candida from respiratory colonization)
Immunosuppression: Maximal (induction therapy ongoing)

1-4 months (Early "at-risk" period):
Peak period for opportunistic infections
CMV disease: 30-50% without prophylaxis (D+R− > D+R+ > D−R+ > D−R−)
Opportunistic organisms: PCP, cryptococcal meningitis, Aspergillus, toxoplasmosis
EBV reactivation and early PTLD: EBV-seronegative recipients at highest risk
Polyomavirus (BK, JC): BK viremia common; BK-associated nephropathy (BKVAN) can develop
Immunosuppression: Still maximal; induction therapy completed

>4-12 months (Intermediate period):
Declining immunosuppression (doses being minimized)
CMV disease declining (if prophylaxis stopped)
Chronic viral infections: BK virus, EBV (PTLD), HCV
Community-acquired: Influence, respiratory viruses in winter months
Immunosuppression: Approaching maintenance levels

>1 year (Late period):
Infections similar to immunocompetent population (if good graft function, maintenance IS)
Community-acquired infections: Influenza, pneumonia, UTI, etc. Chronic viral: Continued BK, EBV monitoring
Recurrent/relapsing infections: If chronic conditions (CMV, TB reactivation)
Immunosuppression: Maintenance levels (minimal)

[Doc_8_Infection:chunk_001] 1.2 Risk Stratification
Tokens: 121
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
High-risk recipients for infection:
1. Degree of immunosuppression:
Induction with lymphocyte-depleting agents (rATG, alemtuzumab) → higher risk
High CNI levels
Addition of second antiproliferative agent

2. Organ type:
Intestine transplant: Highest risk
Heart/lung: Very high risk
Kidney/liver: Moderate-high risk

3. Donor factors:
CMV seropositivity (D+)
Severe illness or prolonged ICU stay (bacterial colonization, aspiration)
Herpes simplex seropositivity
Hepatitis B or C (if transmitted)

4. Recipient factors:
CMV seropositivity status (D+R− at highest risk)
EBV seropositivity status (EBV-negative at risk for severe disease)
Diabetes mellitus
Obesity
Advanced age
Dialysis patients (immune dysfunction)
Repeat transplant recipients
Non-adherence to medications

5. Environmental/epidemiologic:
Seasonal (influenza/respiratory viruses in winter)
Geographic (endemic fungi: Histoplasma in Ohio River valley, Coccidioides in Southwest)
Healthcare-associated (hospital stays, line infections)

[Doc_8_Infection:chunk_002] 2.2 Viral Prophylaxis and Monitoring
Tokens: 486
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### CMV Prophylaxis (Cytomegalovirus)

Risk stratification:
D+R− (donor CMV+, recipient CMV−): Highest risk (~30-50% without prophylaxis)
D+R+, D−R+: Intermediate risk (~10-20%)
D−R−: Lowest risk (<5%)

Prophylactic agents:

| Agent | Dose | Duration | Pros/Cons |
|-------|------|----------|-----------|
| Valganciclovir | 900 mg daily (adjusted for renal function) | 3-4 months (D+R−); 1-3 months (D+R+) | Most common; oral; well tolerated; bone marrow suppression risk |
| Ganciclovir IV | 5 mg/kg BID (adjusted for renal function) | 2-4 weeks → conversion to valganciclovir | For patients unable to take PO; more toxic |
| Acyclovir/Valacyclovir | Acyclovir: 800 mg 4-5×/day; Valacyclovir: 1-2 g QID | 3-6 months | Weaker CMV suppression; mainly HSV/VZV coverage; lower cost |
| Foscarnet | 90 mg/kg BID | Alternative (toxicity, renal) | For ganciclovir-resistant strains; nephrotoxic |
| Cidofovir | 5 mg/kg weekly × 2 weeks | Alternative (rare) | Nephrotoxic; limited use |

Mechanism:
Inhibit viral DNA polymerase
Prevent viral replication; don't eliminate latent virus
Stop at end of prophylaxis period; risk of reactivation

Adverse effects:
Valganciclovir: Neutropenia (dose-dependent; monitor CBC), thrombocytopenia, anemia
Ganciclovir IV: Venoocclusive disease, CNS toxicity
Acyclovir: Neurotoxicity (tremor, confusion; rare)

Monitoring during prophylaxis:
CBC: Baseline, then every 1-2 weeks (monitor for neutropenia)
CMV antigen (pp65) or CMV PCR: NOT routinely done during effective prophylaxis (would be negative)

#### CMV Preemptive Therapy

Alternative to prophylaxis (used in some centers):
No routine prophylaxis given
Frequent CMV monitoring (weekly CMV antigen or PCR)
Preemptive therapy: When CMV detected (before symptoms), treat with valganciclovir or IV ganciclovir

Rationale: Reduce unnecessary prophylaxis; treat only those who develop viremia

Challenges:
Requires frequent monitoring (compliance issues)
Risk of missing CMV disease if viremia progresses rapidly
May miss tissue-invasive CMV (lower viremia load)

Current trend: Most centers prefer prophylaxis (safer, more reliable) over preemptive therapy

#### CMV Treatment (Symptomatic Disease/Syndrome)

Presentations:
CMV syndrome: Fever, malaise, atypical lymphocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia (viremia, not tissue invasion)
CMV pneumonia: Bilateral infiltrates, hypoxemia, respiratory symptoms
CMV colitis/esophagitis: Diarrhea, abdominal pain, dysphagia
CMV retinitis: Floaters, photopsia, visual field changes (ophthalmologic emergency)
CMV hepatitis: Elevated transaminases

Treatment:
Ganciclovir IV: 5 mg/kg BID × 2-3 weeks
Valganciclovir: 900 mg BID × 2-3 weeks (if able to take PO; GI disease contraindication)
Foscarnet: For ganciclovir-resistant strains (rare; HSV/CMV resistant mutants)
Cidofovir: Alternative for resistant strains (nephrotoxic)

Monitoring during treatment:
Repeat CMV antigen/PCR in 1-2 weeks (document clearance)
CBC: Monitor for neutropenia (may require dose reduction)
Renal function: GFR; all agents nephrotoxic
Clinical response: Symptoms improvement, vital signs

Duration: Typically 2-3 weeks; longer if severe disease

#### Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Prophylaxis

Epidemiology:
Incidence of reactivation: 10-30% without prophylaxis
Presentation: Mucocutaneous vesicles (lips, genitals, perirectal)
Severe disease: Esophagitis, pneumonia, disseminated

Prophylaxis agents:
Acyclovir: 400-800 mg 2-4×/day (combined with CMV prophylaxis coverage)
Valacyclovir: 500 mg BID
Duration: 4-12 weeks (often until CMV prophylaxis stopped)

Treatment (symptomatic):
Acyclovir IV: 10 mg/kg Q8h (for severe/disseminated)
Acyclovir PO: 400-800 mg 4-5×/day (for mucocutaneous)
Duration: 7-10 days

[Doc_8_Infection:chunk_003] 2.3 Fungal Prophylaxis
Tokens: 145
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Candida Prophylaxis:
Indications: High-risk recipients (heavy immunosuppression, repeat transplant, diabetes)
Agents: Fluconazole 200-400 mg daily
Duration: 2-4 weeks post-transplant
Mechanism: Azole inhibits ergosterol synthesis in fungal cell membrane

PCP (Pneumocystis jirovecii) Prophylaxis:
Indication: ALL transplant recipients (universal recommendation)
First-line: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)
Dosing: Single-strength or double-strength daily (provides coverage for PCP + some bacterial + Toxoplasma)
Duration: Lifelong (or until CD4 recovery if ever significantly depressed)
Advantages: Broad coverage; cost-effective
Alternative (if TMP-SMX intolerance): Pentamidine inhaled monthly, or atovaquone + azithromycin
Efficacy: Highly effective; PCP now rare in transplant population

Toxoplasmosis Prophylaxis:
Indication: Toxoplasma-seropositive recipients (T+) at risk for reactivation
Prevention: TMP-SMX coverage (provides prophylaxis)
Treatment (if encephalitis develops): Pyrimethamine + sulfadiazine + folinic acid

Aspergillosis Prophylaxis:
Indications: Selective (high-risk recipients, invasive procedure, severe immunosuppression)
Agents: Inhaled or systemic antifungal (itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole)
Duration: Variable (2-4 weeks or longer)
Efficacy: Reduces incidence in high-risk groups

[Doc_8_Infection:chunk_004] 3.1 Viral Monitoring
Tokens: 230
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CMV monitoring:
During prophylaxis: Not routinely needed (should be undetectable)
If symptoms develop: CMV antigen (pp65) or quantitative CMV PCR
Post-prophylaxis: Monthly monitoring in first year (if stopping prophylaxis)
Threshold for preemptive treatment: Variable by center; typically if CMV >1,000 copies/mL

EBV monitoring:
Baseline: EBV serology (IgG, IgM)
Risk assessment: EBV-seronegative recipients higher risk for severe PTLD
Monitoring: EBV PCR (quantitative) at baseline, 1-2 months, 3 months, then periodically
Risk stratification: Rising EBV load → intensify monitoring, consider reduction of IS
Threshold for intervention: Variable; some centers preempt with rituximab if EBV >50,000 copies/mL

BK polyomavirus monitoring (kidney):
Baseline: Baseline BK serology (only identifies prior exposure, not risk)
Monitoring: BK PCR (plasma/urine) at 1, 3, 6, 12 months then periodically
Risk stratification: Increasing BK load → risk for BKVAN
Thresholds: Plasma BK >100,000 copies/mL indicates high risk; urine BK PCR less specific
Intervention: Reduce IS, minimize CNI when BK >100,000; switch CNI if possible; monitor with allograft biopsy if creatinine rising

JC polyomavirus monitoring:
Less common than BK in kidney
PML risk: JC reactivation → progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (CNS disease)
Monitoring: JC PCR if neurologic symptoms develop
Management: Reduce IS aggressively; very high mortality if PML develops

HIV monitoring:
Status: Transplantation in HIV+ recipients now common (HIV+ to HIV+ transplant)
Monitoring: CD4 count, viral load at baseline, periodically post-transplant
Goal: Maintain CD4 >200 cells/μL (similar to non-transplant HIV management)

[Doc_8_Infection:chunk_005] 4.1 Bacterial Infections
Tokens: 136
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Urinary tract infection (UTI):
Diagnosis: Urinalysis + culture; symptoms (dysuria, frequency, suprapubic pain) or asymptomatic bacteriuria
Treatment: Oral fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID) or TMP-SMX (if susceptible); course 7-10 days
Asymptomatic bacteriuria: Treat (unlike general population) due to immunosuppression and graft risk

Pneumonia (bacterial):
Diagnosis: CXR infiltrates, sputum or BAL culture
Organisms: Community-acquired (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae) vs. healthcare-associated (P. aeruginosa, MRSA, Acinetobacter)
Treatment: Empiric broad-spectrum pending culture
Community-acquired: Fluoroquinolone or beta-lactam + macrolide
Healthcare-associated: Anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam + aminoglycoside ± fluoroquinolone
Duration: 10-14 days (adjust if immunosuppression allows)

Blood stream infections (BSI):
Source: Line infection (central line), UTI, intra-abdominal, other
Diagnosis: Blood cultures (2 sets) + clinical signs (fever, hypotension)
Treatment: Empiric broad-spectrum IV antibiotics pending culture
Remove central line if infected
Source control (drainage if abscess, etc.) Duration: 7-14 days (depending on source, organism)
