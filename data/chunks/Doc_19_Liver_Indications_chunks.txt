[Doc_19_Liver_Indications:chunk_000] 1.1 Chronic Liver Disease (CLD) Indications
Tokens: 297
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Primary indications (most common):

| Indication | % of Transplants | MELD Threshold | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Hepatitis C (HCV) | 25-30% | Varies; MELD ≥15 typical | DAAs cure; transplant decisions changing |
| Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) | 20-25% | MELD ≥15-18 | 6-month sobriety typically required |
| Hepatitis B (HBV) | 5-10% | MELD ≥15 | HBIG + antivirals prevent reinfection |
| Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) | 15-20% | MELD ≥15-18 | Growing indication |
| Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) | 5% | Ursodeoxycholic acid failure | Rare; well-tolerated |
| Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) | 5% | Recurrent cholangitis, cancer risk | Inflammatory bowel disease association |
| Cryptogenic cirrhosis | 5-10% | MELD ≥15-18 | Unknown etiology |
| Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) | 2-3% | Corticosteroid-refractory | Good outcomes |
| Hemochromatosis | 2-3% | MELD ≥15 | Excellent prognosis post-transplant |
| Wilson disease | <1% | Early/fulminant | Excellent outcomes with transplant |
| Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency | 1-2% | MELD ≥15 | Prevents lung disease progression |
| Other (PVT, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding) | 5-10% | Variable | Individualized |

MELD score:
Formula: MELD = 3.78 × ln(bilirubin [mg/dL]) + 11.2 × ln(INR) + 9.57 × ln(creatinine [mg/dL]) + 6.43
Range: 6-40+ (higher = sicker)
Clinical significance:
MELD <10: Low priority (low mortality risk on waiting list)
MELD 10-20: Moderate priority
MELD >20: High priority
MELD >30: Very high priority (high mortality on waiting list without transplant)

MELD modifications (exception points):
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): If Milan criteria met, receive MELD exception points (priority boost)
Hepatic encephalopathy: If refractory, may receive exception points
Portal vein thrombosis (PVT): If significant, exception points available
Polycystic liver disease: Exception points for massive hepatomegaly
Other conditions individualized

[Doc_19_Liver_Indications:chunk_001] 2.1 Absolute Contraindications
Tokens: 155
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Contraindication | Rationale | Notes |
|-----------------|----------|-------|
| Uncontrolled active infection | Infection worsens with IS; sepsis incompatible | Must treat first; defer transplant |
| Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma | Metastatic disease; poor transplant outcomes | >Milan or extended criteria |
| Active substance abuse (drugs/alcohol) | Non-adherence risk; recidivism | Alcohol: 6-month sobriety required minimum |
| Severe cardiopulmonary disease (unrepaired) | Surgical risk prohibitive; cannot tolerate IS | CAD, COPD, PAH must be optimized first |
| Significant extrahepatic malignancy | Metastatic disease; limited life expectancy | Depends on cancer type/prognosis |
| Irreversible brain damage | Cannot consent; poor quality of life | Rare; ethical consideration |
| Thrombosis of portal vein AND splenic vein | Surgical reconstruction very difficult | Some centers can manage with options |
| HIV-positive (in non-HIV+ donor context) | High mortality; poor outcomes historically | Now acceptable with controlled HIV + HCV+ donor |

[Doc_19_Liver_Indications:chunk_002] 2.2 Relative Contraindications (Individualize)
Tokens: 173
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Contraindication | Assessment | Management |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|
| Age >65 years | Physiologic age; comorbidities | Often acceptable; outcomes reasonable |
| Severe obesity (BMI >35-40) | Surgical complications | Weight loss program; consider carefully |
| Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) | Technically reconstructible? | If limited thrombosis, transplant possible |
| Hepatitis B (HBsAg+) | Reinfection risk; antiviral available | HBIG + antivirals prevent reinfection |
| Prior abdominal surgery | Technical difficulty | Increased operative time; not contraindication |
| Renal dysfunction (eGFR <30) | Calcineurin inhibitor toxicity | Consider kidney-liver transplant if ESRD |
| Pulmonary hypertension (moderate) | Right heart failure post-transplant | If mPAP <35 mmHg, usually tolerated |
| Severe coronary artery disease (CAD) | Perioperative MI risk | Optimize medically; revascularize if needed |
| Diabetes mellitus | Hyperglycemia; infection risk | Manage perioperatively; not contraindication |
| Psychiatric illness | Adherence, medication management | If stable/treated, not contraindication |
| Low social support | Adherence risk | Assess carefully; offer support services |

[Doc_19_Liver_Indications:chunk_003] 3.1 Medical Assessment
Tokens: 173
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Organ-specific evaluation:

Cardiovascular:
History: Prior MI, CAD, arrhythmia
Physical: Signs of heart failure, volume overload
Testing:
ECG: Baseline
Echocardiography: LVEF, diastolic function, PAP
Stress test or coronary angiography if high-risk
Goal: LVEF >35-40%; tolerate moderate PAP if mPAP <35 mmHg

Hepatic/portal:
Imaging: Ultrasound/CT abdomen assess liver size, cirrhosis, PVT, HCC
Portal vein patency/thrombosis
Splenic vein patency (if PVT, assess splenectomy need)
Ascites presence/severity
Varices assessment

Renal:
Serum creatinine, eGFR: MELD includes creatinine
Proteinuria: Assess for renal disease
If eGFR <30: Consider kidney-liver transplant vs. liver alone

Pulmonary:
History: Shortness of breath, smoking
Physical: Lung sounds, SpO2
Testing:
Chest X-ray: Baseline
PFTs: If COPD suspected (mPAP >35 mmHg relative contraindication)
Chest imaging if nodules concern

Metabolic:
Glucose: Assess for diabetes
Lipids: Dyslipidemia common
Nutrition: Assess for sarcopenia (poor prognosis marker)

Infectious:
Serology: CMV, EBV, HSV, VZV, HIV, HBV, HCV
Screening: TB (IGRA/TST), syphilis, others
Baseline status documented for post-transplant prophylaxis

Malignancy:
Age-appropriate screening: Colon, breast, prostate, cervix (if not contraindicated)
HCC screening: Ultrasound ± AFP (if cirrhosis)
History: Prior malignancy → assess cancer-free interval

[Doc_19_Liver_Indications:chunk_004] 3.2 Psychosocial Evaluation
Tokens: 143
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Components:

| Area | Assessment |
|------|-----------|
| Psychiatric history | Prior/current mental illness; treatment status |
| Substance use | Alcohol/drugs; recovery if history |
| Adherence | Prior medication compliance |
| Support system | Family, social support present? |
| Motivation | Understands transplant process; realistic expectations |
| Coping skills | Ability to handle stress, manage complications |
| Financial | Insurance, ability to afford IS/medications |
| Health literacy | Understands need for post-transplant follow-up |

Red flags:
Active substance abuse (alcohol or drugs)
Untreated psychiatric illness
Severe social isolation
Unrealistic expectations ("transplant = cure")
Financial barriers to adherence

6-month sobriety rule (alcohol-induced cirrhosis):
Rationale: Assess commitment to abstinence; allow liver recovery; reduce recurrent alcohol use risk
Exception: Fulminant hepatic failure from alcohol (more forgiving; some transplant without waiting)
Monitoring: Regular drug screening, support programs (AA, rehabilitation)
