Organ: kidney
================================================================================

[Doc_11_Kidney_Evaluation:chunk_000] 1.1 General Indication: End-Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD)
Tokens: 151
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Definition: Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <15 mL/min/1.73m² or requirement for renal replacement therapy

Benefits of transplantation vs. dialysis:

| Outcome | Transplant | Dialysis | Difference |
|---------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Median survival | 12-20 years | 4-5 years | 8-15 years longer |
| Cardiovascular mortality | Lower | Higher (>50% of deaths) | Significantly reduced |
| Infection rate | Lower | Higher | Transplant safer |
| Quality of life | Excellent | Restricted | Superior |
| Employment rate | 40-50% | 10-15% | Much higher |
| Cost per life-year | Lower | Higher | Transplant cost-effective |
| Hospitalizations | Fewer | More frequent | Fewer with transplant |
| Dietary restrictions | Minimal | Significant | Much more freedom |

Survival benefit:
Transplant recipient: 15-year median survival ~60% (KDIGO data)
Dialysis patient: 15-year survival ~20%
Relative mortality reduction: ~70% with transplant (adjusted for age, comorbidities)

[Doc_11_Kidney_Evaluation:chunk_001] 2.1 Absolute Contraindications (Transplant Not Performed)
Tokens: 198
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Active, untreated malignancy:
Ongoing malignancy not controlled by active therapy
Exception: Basalioma, non-melanoma skin cancer (can transplant with surveillance)
Rationale: Immunosuppression accelerates cancer progression; worse outcomes with active disease

Uncontrolled life-threatening infection:
Active sepsis, osteomyelitis with bacteremia, active endocarditis, active tuberculosis
Rationale: Immunosuppression worsens infection; untreated disease incompatible with surgery
Resolution: Treat infection; re-evaluate when controlled

Inability to adhere to medication regimen (severe, documented):
Demonstrated pattern of medication non-adherence with serious consequences (transplant failure, rejection)
Rationale: Non-adherence to immunosuppression guarantees graft failure
Assessment: Psychosocial evaluation identifies barriers; education, support systems may improve adherence

Uncontrolled active substance abuse (heroin, cocaine, alcohol):
Current active use; not distant past history
Rationale: Impairs adherence, immune function, medical judgment
Exception: Stable recovery/sobriety can make transplant appropriate; individualize assessment

Severe psychiatric illness with active suicidality or homicidality:
Uncontrolled bipolar disorder, major depression with suicidal ideation, psychosis
Rationale: Safety concern; risk of harm to self or others incompatible with transplant (surgical risk, medication management)
Note: Psychiatric illness itself not contraindication if stable and treated

Severe untreated/uncontrollable cardiovascular disease:
Acute coronary syndrome, uncontrolled arrhythmia, acute decompensated heart failure (NYHA IV)
Rationale: Surgical risk too high
Note: Controlled cardiovascular disease not contraindication; may require optimization first

[Doc_11_Kidney_Evaluation:chunk_002] 2.2 Relative Contraindications (Considered; May Transplant with Discussion/Modification)
Tokens: 315
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advanced age:
No absolute age cutoff; some transplant recipients 75-80+ years old
Risk factors: Frailty, comorbidities, reduced life expectancy
Assessment: Functional status, physiologic age (not chronologic), predicted life-years benefit
Management: Careful donor selection (lower KDPI organs), enhanced monitoring

Significant obesity (BMI >40):
Surgical complications: Wound infection, delayed healing, graft compression
Metabolic complications: Diabetes, dyslipidemia
Management: Preoperative weight loss program; bariatric surgery if needed; careful donor matching

Severe peripheral vascular disease:
Affects surgical approach (iliac vessels may be diseased)
Risk: Vascular complications, graft thrombosis
Assessment: Angiography if significant disease
Management: Surgical approach modification; vascular intervention if needed

Severe coronary artery disease (CAD):
Relative contraindication; absolute contraindication only if uncontrollable/unstable
Risk: Perioperative MI
Assessment: Stress test or coronary angiography if suspected high risk
Management: Optimization (medical therapy, revascularization if indicated); timing of transplant

Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD):
Surgical anesthesia risk
Assessment: Pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas
Management: Optimization; timing consideration

Moderate-to-severe chronic liver disease:
Affects metabolic drug handling, infection risk, coagulopathy
Assessment: INR, albumin, ultrasound for cirrhosis
Management: Liver biopsy if unclear; combined liver-kidney transplant if cirrhotic

Hepatitis B or C infection:
Historically contraindication; now manageable
HBV: Antiviral prophylaxis (tenofovir, lamivudine)
HCV: Direct-acting antivirals can cure infection; transplant after cure or during immunosuppression
Management: Infectious disease consultation; baseline liver assessment

HIV infection:
Formerly absolute contraindication; now relative
Current: HIV+ recipients can receive HIV+ organs or negative organs with suppressed CD4 >200 cells/μL
Management: Infectious disease consultation; ensure undetectable viral load; antiretroviral therapy

Severe psychiatric illness (stable on treatment):
Psychiatric diagnosis itself not contraindication; stability essential
Assessment: Psychiatric evaluation; ensure medication adherence
Management: Continue psychiatric care; transplant center coordination

Previous non-compliance with medical care:
Not absolute if patient demonstrates insight and improved adherence
Assessment: Detailed history; understanding of need for compliance
Management: Education, support systems, frequent monitoring

Undiagnosed or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus:
HbA1c >8-9% → increased surgical complications, infections
Management: Glycemic control optimization pre-transplant

[Doc_11_Kidney_Evaluation:chunk_003] 3.1 Cardiovascular Evaluation
Tokens: 197
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Risk stratification:
Low risk: Age <50, no cardiac symptoms, no risk factors
Intermediate risk: Age 50-70, or cardiac risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, prior MI/angina, abnormal ECG)
High risk: Age >70, multiple risk factors, prior cardiac events, heart failure

Evaluation components:

| Risk Level | Evaluation |
|-----------|-----------|
| Low | History, physical exam, ECG, baseline troponin |
| Intermediate | Above + stress test (exercise or pharmacologic) or coronary CTA |
| High | Above + coronary angiography (if stress test abnormal or high suspicion) |
| Very high (prior CAD) | Coronary angiography |

Specific tests:
ECG: Baseline rhythm, ischemic changes, prior MI pattern, LVH
Troponin: Baseline; elevated troponin → high-risk (coronary angiography)
Echocardiography: LVEF, diastolic function, valvular disease, regional wall motion abnormality
Stress testing:
Treadmill (if mobile, normal baseline ECG)
Pharmacologic (dobutamine, adenosine, regadenoson) if unable to exercise
Sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~70% (moderate test)
Coronary CTA: Non-invasive coronary imaging; increasingly used (sensitivity >95%)
Coronary angiography: Gold standard; invasive; reserved for high-risk or if stress test abnormal

Management if CAD found:
Medical optimization: Aspirin, beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, statin
Revascularization: PCI or CABG if significant stenosis
Timing: Delay transplant 2-4 weeks post-revascularization if possible (healing)

[Doc_11_Kidney_Evaluation:chunk_004] 3.2 Malignancy Screening
Tokens: 179
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Principles:
Screen for current malignancy (contraindication)
Assess cancer risk (modified IS may be recommended)
Establish baseline (post-transplant surveillance context)

Screening by age and sex:

| Screening | Frequency | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Colon (age 45-75) | Every 10 years (colonoscopy) or 5 years (sigmoidoscopy) | Earlier/more frequent if high-risk |
| Breast (age 40-74) | Annual mammography or MRI if high-risk | Clinical breast exam annually |
| Cervix (age 21-65) | Every 3 years (Pap) or every 5 years (HPV) | Earlier start if immunocompromised |
| Prostate (age 50+) | Individualized (shared decision-making); PSA ± DRE | Earlier if family history, African American |
| Skin | Dermatology exam (full-body); annual thereafter | Pre-transplant baseline |
| Lung (high-risk smokers) | Low-dose CT if 50-80 years, 20 pack-year history | Screen annually if abnormal |
| Liver ultrasound (HCV/HBV+) | Every 6 months | If cirrhosis risk |

Cancer-free waiting intervals (not absolute; individualized):
Melanoma: 2-5 years
Other solid tumors: 2-3 years
Breast: 2-5 years
Basal cell carcinoma, in situ cervical cancer: Transplant after excision

[Doc_11_Kidney_Evaluation:chunk_005] 3.3 Infectious Disease Evaluation
Tokens: 240
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Serologies at baseline:

| Test | Indication | Action if Positive |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| HIV | Universal screening | Relative contraindication (can transplant if undetectable and CD4 >200) |
| HBsAg (HBV) | Universal | Document; antiviral prophylaxis if considering HBV+ donor |
| Anti-HBc, anti-HBs | Universal | Assess immunity; vaccination if negative |
| Anti-HCV (HCV) | Universal | Confirm with RNA; can transplant; DAA therapy post-TX if needed |
| CMV serology | Universal | D+R− designation (high prophylaxis/monitoring) |
| EBV serology | Universal | EBV-negative recipients flagged for enhanced PTLD monitoring |
| RPR/TPPA (syphilis) | Universal | Treat if positive; neurosyphilis screening if symptomatic |
| Strongyloides serology | Universal or endemic areas | Treat before transplant if positive (ivermectin) |
| TB (IGRA or TST) | Universal | If positive, rule out active TB; treat LTBI if positive |
| Toxoplasma serology | Consider (varies by region) | If positive, TMP-SMX prophylaxis post-TX covers |
| Hepatitis A serology | Consider | If negative, vaccinate pre-TX |

Active infection assessment:
Blood cultures if febrile or septic
Urinalysis/culture (assess for UTI; treat if positive)
Chest X-ray (assess for pulmonary infection, TB)
Assessment for opportunistic infections (PCP prophylaxis covers risk)

Latent infection management:
LTBI (positive IGRA/TST): Treat before transplant (INH × 9 months or RIPE × 4 months) to prevent TB reactivation post-transplant
Strongyloides: Treat before transplant (ivermectin × 2 doses) to prevent hyperinfection

[Doc_11_Kidney_Evaluation:chunk_006] 3.4 Immunologic Evaluation
Tokens: 152
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABO blood type: Required for compatibility

HLA typing: 
HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, -DQ, -DP (6 loci initially; extended panel for matching)
Determines compatibility with donor

Panel reactive antibody (PRA):
Older test; measures % of donor HLA types patient would react to
Replaced by calculated Panel Reactive Antibody (cPRA) in most centers

Calculated Panel Reactive Antibody (cPRA):
More accurate estimate of sensitization
cPRA 0%: No sensitization (easy to match)
cPRA 1-50%: Mild sensitization
cPRA 51-97%: Moderate-to-high sensitization
cPRA >97%: Highly sensitized (very difficult to match; priority allocation)

Donor-specific antibodies (DSA):
Anti-HLA antibodies directed against specific donor HLA types
Assessed via single-antigen bead (SAB) testing
Positive DSA: Contraindication to transplant (donor-specific); high rejection risk
Negative DSA: Compatible (desensitization may be considered if patient had prior sensitization)

Crossmatch testing (complement-dependent cytotoxicity or flow cytometry):
Functional test of donor-specific reactivity
Positive: Contraindication (hyperacute rejection risk)
Increasingly replaced by virtual crossmatch (HLA/DSA testing) in low-risk populations
