[Doc_20_Liver_Donor_Periop:chunk_000] 1.1 Donor Quality Assessment
Tokens: 128
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard criteria donor (SCD):
Age <60 years
No steatosis on histology, or <20% macrovascular steatosis
AST/ALT <2× upper limit of normal
Negative culture
Stable hemodynamics (MAP >70 mmHg)
No significant liver disease

Extended criteria donor (ECD) characteristics:
Age >60 years (particularly >70)
Elevated transaminases (AST/ALT >2× ULN)
Fatty infiltration (>20% macrovascular steatosis on biopsy)
Steatohepatitis (NASH): Fatty infiltration + inflammation/fibrosis
Cold ischemia time >12 hours
DCD donation (donation after cardiac death)
Hepatitis C seropositive (historically; now often transplanted with DAA therapy)
Mild-moderate renal dysfunction (GFR 50-80)

Donor risk index (DRI):
Quantifies donor quality; used to match with recipient risk
Higher DRI = higher risk graft
Recipients with good expected function (lower MELD) → may match with higher DRI organs
Recipients sicker → prefer lower DRI organs (less risk)

[Doc_20_Liver_Donor_Periop:chunk_001] 1.2 Hepatic Steatosis Assessment
Tokens: 111
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clinical significance:
Macrovascular steatosis (>30%) → significantly increases primary graft dysfunction, early dysfunction risk
Microvascular steatosis → less prognostic value; may be reversible with reperfusion

Assessment methods:
Visual inspection (intraoperative): Experienced surgeon can estimate
Liver biopsy (percutaneous): Gold standard for histology
Indications: ECD donor, elevated transaminases, imaging suggests steatosis
Grading: % macrovascular steatosis (goal <20-30%)
If >30-40%: High risk; decline or use cautiously
Imaging (ultrasound, CT): Qualitative assessment
Hyperechoicity (ultrasound) suggests steatosis
Less specific than biopsy; not reliable for degree

Management if steatosis present:
Avoid further risk (e.g., if also older, consider declining)
Match with lower-MELD recipient (more functional reserve)
Minimize cold ischemia time
Consider machine perfusion (may improve recovery)

[Doc_20_Liver_Donor_Periop:chunk_002] 1.3 Viral and Serologic Status
Tokens: 101
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hepatitis C (HCV):
Historically contraindication
Now: Many centers transplant HCV+ donors to HCV+ recipients
Rationale: Antiviral therapy (DAAs) can cure HCV post-transplant; outcomes excellent
Also: HCV+ organs to HCV− recipients if carefully managed (rare)

Hepatitis B (HBV):
HBsAg+ donor: Relative contraindication traditionally
Now: Transplant to HBsAg− recipient with HBIG + antivirals
HBIG (hepatitis B immunoglobulin) passive prophylaxis
Antivirals (entecavir, tenofovir) prevent reinfection
Outcomes improved with modern prophylaxis

HIV:
Historically absolute contraindication
Emerging: HIV+ organs to HIV+ recipients with controlled CD4 >200
Limited experience; specialized centers only

CMV/EBV status:
Documented; guides prophylaxis
D+R− higher risk for CMV disease (standard prophylaxis applies)

[Doc_20_Liver_Donor_Periop:chunk_003] 2.2 Operative Technique
Tokens: 128
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Donor hepatectomy:
Standard ex situ technique: Liver removed, flushed with cold solution on back table
In situ flush: Aortic cannulation; cold solution infused through hepatic artery; vena cava vented
Careful dissection: Preserve all structures (hepatic artery, portal vein, bile duct, suprahepatic/infrahepatic IVC)
Portal vein/hepatic artery backflushing to clear blood, reduce IRI

Allograft preservation:
Cold preservation solution: UW or HTK
Flush volume: 500-1000 mL
Temperature: 0-4°C (hypothermia reduces metabolism)
Transport: Sterile container, ice, rapid transport

Cold ischemia time:
Acceptable: Up to 12-15 hours (preferably <8 hours)
Effect: Each hour increases primary graft dysfunction risk ~1-2%
>20 hours: Significantly increased dysfunction, ischemic cholangiopathy risk

Machine perfusion (emerging):
HOPE (hypothermic oxygenated perfusion): Reduces ischemic cholangiopathy in ECD livers
Normothermic perfusion: Experimental; enables assessment, potential "reconditioning"
Benefits: Improved function; extended preservation window

[Doc_20_Liver_Donor_Periop:chunk_004] 2.4 Recipient Hepatectomy and Allograft Implantation
Tokens: 238
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Native hepatectomy:
Dissection: Around hepatic hilum, careful hemostasis
Vascular control: Infrahepatic IVC clamped; suprahepatic IVC clamped
Hepatic artery: Divided and ligated
Portal vein: Divided and ligated
Bile duct: Divided and ligated
Liver removed: Careful to avoid spillage

Anhepatic phase:
Duration: 30-120 minutes typically (vascular clamps in place)
Hemodynamic management: Relative hypotension expected (decreased venous return); support with fluids, vasopressors
Coagulopathy: Severe in this phase; massive transfusion risk

Allograft implantation:

Suprahepatic IVC anastomosis (piggyback technique increasingly common):
Graft suprahepatic vein anastomosed to recipient IVC (end-to-side)
Preserves recipient IVC flow (lower hemodynamic impact)
Clamping: Suprahepatic IVC clamped above anastomosis; no aortic cross-clamp needed

Infrahepatic IVC anastomosis (traditional):
Graft infrahepatic vein anastomosed to recipient infrahepatic IVC (end-to-end)
Requires aortic cross-clamping (if vena cava below renal veins also clamped)
More hemodynamic impairment

Portal vein anastomosis:
Graft portal vein anastomosed to recipient portal vein (end-to-end, or end-to-side)
Typical: End-to-end to avoid stenosis

Hepatic artery anastomosis:
Graft hepatic artery to recipient hepatic artery (end-to-end)
Alternative: Aortic interposition (if severe recipient atherosclerosis)

Bile duct anastomosis:
Duct-to-duct (most common): Graft common bile duct anastomosed to recipient common bile duct
Requires patent recipient bile duct
Advantage: Preserves sphincter of Oddi function; allows endoscopic management if stricture
Choledochocholedochostomy (duct-to-duct variant)
Choledochojejunostomy: If recipient bile duct unavailable (post-cholecystectomy with failed ERCP, PSC with complex strictures)
Roux-en-Y jejunal loop anastomosed to graft bile duct
Advantage: Single anastomosis, no sphincter obstruction
Disadvantage: Ascending cholangitis risk higher; harder to access endoscopically

[Doc_20_Liver_Donor_Periop:chunk_005] 3.1 Early Graft Function
Tokens: 100
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Immediate function (most common; ~70%):
Rapid INR correction (by 2-4 hours)
Early bile production
Creatinine begins declining (as renal perfusion improves)
Excellent outcomes expected

Slow graft function (~20-25%):
Gradual INR improvement (takes days)
Delayed bile production
High bilirubin, transaminases
Coagulopathy persists 2-7 days
Manage with close monitoring, ICU support
Most eventually recover full function

Primary graft dysfunction (PGD; ~5-15%):
Severe dysfunction: Coagulopathy persists, jaundice profound, graft failure imminent
Severe PGD mortality: 40-60% require retransplantation
Definition varies (fulminant, severe; based on INR, bilirubin, transaminases at 3-7 days)

Primary graft non-function (very rare; <1%):
Complete loss of function
Retransplantation required emergently

[Doc_20_Liver_Donor_Periop:chunk_006] 4. SUMMARY AND KEY CONCEPTS
Tokens: 107
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Donor quality: SCD vs. ECD classification; DRI quantifies risk
2. Steatosis assessment: Biopsy gold standard; >30% increases graft dysfunction risk
3. HCV+ donors: Now acceptable with DAA therapy; improved outcomes
4. Cold ischemia time: <8 hours preferred; >20 hours high risk for dysfunction
5. Machine perfusion: HOPE reduces ischemic cholangiopathy in ECD livers
6. Perioperative hemodynamics: Careful fluid management, vasopressor support needed
7. Bile duct anastomosis: Duct-to-duct preferred; choledochojejunostomy if duct unavailable
8. Immediate graft function: ~70% excellent; ~20-25% slow; ~5-15% primary graft dysfunction
9. Early complications: Vascular (HAT, PVT), biliary (leak, stricture), hemorrhage
