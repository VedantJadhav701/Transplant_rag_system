For example, UNOS kidney allocation:\nUtility component (LYFT score): Predicts post-transplant life expectancy; higher scores (longer predicted life) get higher priority\nJustice component (wait time): Years on waiting list; longer wait gets priority\nEquity component (CPRA sensitization): Very high CPRA candidates get extra priority (fairness due to limited compatible donors)\nNeed component (medical urgency): Dialysis status, comorbidities; more urgent candidates prioritized\nRegional equity: Organs allocated to regional candidates first, then nationally\n\nInherent tensions:\nMaximizing utility might mean giving best organs to healthiest (youngest) candidates \u2192 may increase population benefit but disadvantages elderly/sick\nPure wait-time fairness might give organs to least-urgent candidates \u2192 reduces overall benefit\nSensitization priority creates complex allocation but improves fairness for disadvantaged subpopulation\n\n---",

    "text": "The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) system is the most polymorphic genetic system in humans, with >25,000 identified HLA alleles[1]. Despite this extreme diversity, only 60-70 of the most frequently occurring alleles are typically considered for organ transplantation compatibility testing[1]. The HLA system comprises two major classes:\n\nHLA Class I molecules (HLA-A, -B, -C) are expressed on all nucleated cells and present intracellular peptides to CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). These molecules consist of a polymorphic \u03b1-chain, \u03b22-microglobulin, and bound peptide. HLA Class II molecules (HLA-DR, -DQ, -DP) are expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells (dendritic cells, B cells, macrophages) and present exogenous peptides to CD4+ helper T cells. Class II molecules consist of \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains, both of which are polymorphic. The peptide-binding region (PBR) of HLA molecules contains the most polymorphic amino acid positions. These positions determine which peptides can bind and be presented to T cells, fundamentally shaping the immune response to the transplanted organ.",

    "text": "Alloimmunization occurs when the transplant recipient's immune system recognizes donor HLA molecules as foreign and mounts an adaptive immune response. Three main pathways of HLA allorecognition operate:\n\n#### Direct Allorecognition\nIn the direct pathway, recipient T cells directly recognize intact donor HLA molecules on donor antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that persist in the transplant[3]. This is the dominant pathway in acute rejection and is particularly effective because intact donor HLA/peptide complexes can activate high frequencies of recipient T cells (0.1-10% of circulating T cells recognize allogeneic HLA). The direct pathway is especially important early post-transplant when donor lymphoid cells are present. #### Indirect Allorecognition\nIn the indirect pathway, recipient APCs process and present peptides derived from donor HLA molecules (and other alloantigen) in the context of recipient HLA to recipient T cells[3]. This pathway becomes increasingly important over time as donor APCs disappear and mimics the response to exogenous antigens (such as infectious pathogens). The indirect pathway is thought to be primarily responsible for chronic rejection through activation of helper T cells that license B cells to produce donor-specific antibodies (DSA). #### Semi-direct Allorecognition\nIn the semi-direct pathway, recipient APCs acquire intact allogeneic HLA molecules from dying donor cells or APCs and present them at the cell surface. This hybrid pathway may explain certain aspects of B-cell activation and antibody production.",

    "text": "The development of donor-specific antibodies (DSA) is a hallmark of alloimmunization. This process involves:\n\n1. T-cell help: CD4+ helper T cells (particularly Tfh cells in germinal centers) provide interleukin-21 and CD40-CD40L signals to B cells recognizing donor HLA. 2. B-cell activation and clonal selection: B cells specific for donor HLA undergo proliferation and selection in germinal centers within secondary lymphoid organs. 3. Affinity maturation: Through somatic hypermutation and selection, B-cell receptors with higher affinity for donor HLA are generated. 4. Plasma cell differentiation and memory formation: Some B cells differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells; others become long-lived memory B cells. The classes of DSA produced follow a pattern:\nIgM DSA: Often transient, may appear early after sensitization (e.g., transfusion, pregnancy)\nIgG DSA: More persistent, consist of subclasses IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 with varying complement-fixing ability\nIgA DSA: Less well characterized but increasingly recognized as potentially pathogenic\n\nThe presence and persistence of DSA is a major risk factor for antibody-mediated rejection (AMR). ---",

However, the actual immunogenic determinants on HLA molecules are much smaller structures called epitopes and specifically eplets (clusters of amino acids that form antibody binding sites). #### Definition and Identification\n\nEplets are defined as short amino acid sequences (typically 5-8 amino acids) on the HLA molecule surface that can be recognized by HLA-specific antibodies. The concept has evolved from:\nMonoclonal antibody studies identifying discrete epitopes\nHuman alloantibody analysis showing fine specificity\nComputational immunology predicting eplet mismatches from HLA sequences[4]\n\nRecent algorithms (e.g., HLAmatch, PIRCHE) compute eplet incompatibility from donor-recipient HLA typing by comparing amino acid sequences. #### Clinical Significance\n\nStudies demonstrate that eplet mismatch load predicts rejection risk independently of conventional HLA mismatches[4]:\nSenev et al. found that eplet mismatch load was associated with:\nIncreased de novo DSA (dnDSA) formation\nHigher rates of T-cell-mediated rejection (5% increased odds per mismatch)\nHigher rates of antibody-mediated rejection (12% increased odds per mismatch)\nGraft failure\nIn recipients considered \"low risk\" by traditional matching (0-2 HLA-ABDR antigen mismatches), those with \u226520 eplet mismatches had adjusted HR 1.85 (95% CI 1.11-3.08) for rejection vs. those with <20 eplet mismatches\nDQ eplet mismatches are particularly immunogenic\n\n#### Clinical Application\n\nEplet matching is increasingly incorporated into:\nLiving donor selection (choosing the donor with lowest eplet mismatch)\nKidney paired donation programs (finding compatible pairs with reduced eplet incompatibility)\nOrgan allocation algorithms (incorporating eplet mismatch scores)\nRisk stratification for induction immunosuppression intensity\n\n---",

Transfusion-related HLA sensitization is less common in the modern era due to leukoreduction of blood products and widespread use of immunosuppression. #### Pregnancy\nMaternal-fetal trafficking of fetal HLA-incompatible cells can induce maternal anti-HLA responses.

This results in:\nVery high frequency of alloreactive T cells (0.1-10% of circulating T lymphocytes)\nDominant pathway in the immediate post-transplant period\nRapid kinetics of T-cell activation\n\nImmunological basis:\nDonor bone marrow-derived cells (dendritic cells, macrophages, B lymphocytes) migrate from the graft to secondary lymphoid organs\nRecipient T cells recognize donor MHC molecules as antigen-presenting structures\nBoth CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses are activated\nResults in vigorous alloreactive T-cell proliferation and effector function\n\n#### Indirect Allorecognition\n\nMechanism:\nRecipient professional APCs (primarily dendritic cells and B cells) process and present peptides derived from intact donor HLA antigens in the context of recipient HLA to recipient T cells. This pathway:\nBecomes increasingly important over time as donor-derived APCs disappear\nMirrors the normal response to exogenous antigens\nActivates CD4+ helper T cells (predominantly Th1 and Th17)\nIs thought to be the primary pathway driving chronic rejection through B-cell licensing and donor-specific antibody (DSA) production\n\n#### Semi-direct Allorecognition\n\nMechanism:\nRecipient APCs acquire intact donor HLA molecules (through exosomes, membrane fragments, or transfer from other APCs) and present them at their own cell surface to recipient T cells. This hybrid pathway:\nMay explain certain aspects of B-cell activation\nCan activate both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells\nContributes to sustained alloimmune response",

Acute rejection is immune-mediated graft injury orchestrated by both T cells (direct allorecognition dominant early) and B cells/antibodies (indirect pathway important for chronic progression). 2. Early diagnosis is critical: Clinical suspicion + tissue biopsy (gold standard) + laboratory studies (DSA, biomarkers, dd-cfDNA) enable prompt intervention. 3. Acute cellular rejection responds well to corticosteroid pulse therapy (70-90%); steroid-resistant cases require lymphocyte-depleting antibodies (rATG, alemtuzumab). 4. Antibody-mediated rejection requires multi-modal therapy: plasma exchange/immunoadsorption + IVIG + rituximab \u00b1 complement inhibition. Long-term outcomes variable. 5.

    "text": "Why indirect allorecognition becomes dominant in chronic rejection:\n\nUnlike acute rejection, where direct allorecognition (recipient T cells recognizing intact donor HLA on donor APCs) predominates, chronic rejection is primarily driven by indirect allorecognition[1]:\n\n1. Donor-derived APCs disappear over weeks to months as:\nGraft-infiltrating dendritic cells and macrophages emigrate to recipient lymphoid organs\nResident donor APCs are cleared or die\nDirect pathway becomes inactive\n\n2. Recipient APCs present processed donor antigens:\nRecipient dendritic cells and B cells internalize donor HLA molecules (from apoptotic cells, exosomes, membrane fragments)\nProcess them into peptides\nPresent peptide-HLA complexes on recipient MHC to recipient T cells\nThis is the normal response to exogenous antigens\n\n3. Sustained CD4+ Th cell response:\nCD4+ helper T cells specific for indirect pathway (INDIRECT-responding T cells) are activated\nThese cells persist in secondary lymphoid organs throughout the post-transplant period\nProduce IL-2, IL-17, TNF-\u03b1 (pro-inflammatory cytokines)\n\n4. B-cell licensure and donor-specific antibodies (DSA):\nActivated CD4+ helper cells provide critical signals to B cells via CD40-CD40L interaction\nB cells specific for donor HLA receive T-cell help\nGerminal centers form; B cells undergo somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation\nLong-lived memory B cells and plasma cells develop\nResult: Persistent or newly-formed (de novo) donor-specific antibodies\n\nCritical concept: Indirect allorecognition is difficult to suppress with standard immunosuppression (which primarily targets direct pathway early post-transplant). This explains why chronic rejection continues despite adequate maintenance immunosuppression[1].",

Absence of Cerebral Function\nUnresponsiveness to external stimuli\nNo purposeful responses (distinguish from reflex responses)\nNo vocalizations\nNo eye opening (spontaneous or to stimuli)\n\n2. Absence of Brainstem Reflexes\n\n| Reflex | Test | Normal Response | Brain Dead Response |\n|--------|------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| Pupillary light reflex | Shine light in pupils | Constrict | No response; pupils mid-range (4-6 mm) or dilated |\n| Corneal reflex (blink reflex) | Touch cornea with cotton wisp | Blink | No response |\n| Oculocephalic reflex (doll's eyes) | Rotate head side-to-side; eyes move opposite head | Eyes follow; move opposite head direction | Eyes stay fixed to midline (no movement) |\n| Caloric reflex (ice water calorics) | Irrigate ear canal with ice water | Eyes move toward stimulated side | No eye movement |\n| Gag reflex | Stimulate posterior pharynx | Gag | No response |\n| Cough reflex | Pass endotracheal tube suction down | Cough | No response |\n\n3. Absence of Motor Responses\nNo movement to stimuli\nDistinguish:\nPurposeful movement: Withdrawal from pain, reaching, grasping (incompatible with brain death)\nReflexive movement: Spinal reflexes (acceptable in brain death)\nFlexor/extensor reflexes\nBabinski reflex\nThese occur below level of brainstem\nSpinal reflex test: Apply noxious stimulus (pinch) \u2192 reflex withdrawal compatible with brain death\n\n4. Apnea Test (Most Important; Confirms Brainstem Death)\n\nPurpose: Verify absent respiratory drive; confirm brainstem death\n\nProcedure:\n1. Pre-oxygenate: 100% O2 \u00d7 10 minutes (target PaO2 >200 mmHg)\n2. Disconnect ventilator\n3. Provide passive oxygenation (via endotracheal tube): Oxygen at 6-8 L/minute\n4. Observe chest for respiratory effort \u00d7 8-10 minutes\n5. Check arterial blood gas at end: Target CO2 >60 mmHg (to stimulate respiratory drive if brainstem intact)\n6. If no respiratory effort observed AND CO2 >60 mmHg \u2192 apnea test POSITIVE (supports brain death)\n\nPositive test criteria (any ONE):)\nNo respiratory effort with CO2 \u226560 mmHg, OR\nNo respiratory effort with increase in CO2 \u226520 mmHg from baseline\n\nApnea test failure (inconclusive):\nIf blood pressure drops <90 mmHg systolic (hypoxemia)\nIf SpO2 drops <85% (hypoxemia)\nIf cardiac arrhythmia develops\n\u2192 Reconnect ventilator; retry later or perform ancillary test\n\n---",
