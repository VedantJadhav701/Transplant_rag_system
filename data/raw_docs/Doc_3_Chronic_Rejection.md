# DOCUMENT 3: CHRONIC REJECTION AND ALLOGRAFT VASCULOPATHY

## Executive Summary

Chronic rejection represents the long-term, progressive loss of graft function occurring months to years after transplantation. Unlike acute rejection, which is characterized by sudden graft dysfunction responding to immunosuppressive therapy, chronic rejection develops insidiously through multiple interrelated mechanisms: immunologic (ongoing alloimmunization, donor-specific antibodies, T-cell dysfunction), non-immunologic (hypertension, proteinuria, nephrotoxicity), ischemic (delayed graft function), and infectious factors. Chronic allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the pathologic hallmark—concentric neointimal thickening of graft vessels resulting in progressive coronary or renal artery stenosis. This document synthesizes the mechanisms, risk factors, pathologic features, and preventive strategies for chronic rejection across solid organ transplantation.

## 1. DEFINITIONS AND CLASSIFICATION

### 1.1 Chronic Rejection vs. Chronic Allograft Dysfunction

**Chronic Allograft Rejection (CAR):**
Immunologically-mediated graft injury developing over months to years, characterized by progressive functional decline and specific pathologic findings on biopsy. Driven by ongoing donor-specific immune responses (both T-cell and B-cell mediated).

**Chronic Allograft Dysfunction (CAD):**
Broader clinical term describing progressive, irreversible loss of graft function regardless of etiology—encompasses both chronic rejection (immunologic) and chronic non-rejection factors (recurrent disease, hypertension, CNI toxicity, infection).

**Key distinction:** Not all chronic graft dysfunction is chronic rejection. Multiple non-immunologic factors contribute significantly to long-term graft loss[1]:
- Recurrent/de novo kidney disease
- Chronic calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) toxicity
- Hypertension
- Proteinuria
- Chronic infection (CMV, polyomavirus)
- Donor factors (age, ischemic time)

### 1.2 Banff Classification of Chronic Changes

The 2019 Banff update classifies chronic changes in renal allograft biopsies:

**Chronic T-cell-mediated rejection (CTM-R):**
- Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA), typically without acute inflammation
- Requires contextual diagnosis based on HLA mismatching, prior acute rejection episodes
- Vasculopathy (arterial sclerosis)

**Chronic antibody-mediated rejection (CAM-R):**
- Glomerular basement membrane double contours (GBM spikes/"spike-and-dome" appearance) indicating transplant glomerulopathy
- Peritubular capillary basement membrane multilayering
- Persistent donor-specific antibodies (DSA)
- C4d deposition in capillaries (suggests ongoing complement activation)

**Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA):**
- Nonspecific, can result from multiple etiologies (chronic rejection, recurrent disease, CNI toxicity, ischemia)
- Classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on extent

## 2. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF CHRONIC REJECTION

### 2.1 The Role of Alloimmunization: Indirect Allorecognition

**Why indirect allorecognition becomes dominant in chronic rejection:**

Unlike acute rejection, where direct allorecognition (recipient T cells recognizing intact donor HLA on donor APCs) predominates, **chronic rejection is primarily driven by indirect allorecognition**[1]:

1. **Donor-derived APCs disappear** over weeks to months as:
   - Graft-infiltrating dendritic cells and macrophages emigrate to recipient lymphoid organs
   - Resident donor APCs are cleared or die
   - Direct pathway becomes inactive

2. **Recipient APCs present processed donor antigens:**
   - Recipient dendritic cells and B cells internalize donor HLA molecules (from apoptotic cells, exosomes, membrane fragments)
   - Process them into peptides
   - Present peptide-HLA complexes on recipient MHC to recipient T cells
   - This is the normal response to exogenous antigens

3. **Sustained CD4+ Th cell response:**
   - CD4+ helper T cells specific for indirect pathway (INDIRECT-responding T cells) are activated
   - These cells persist in secondary lymphoid organs throughout the post-transplant period
   - Produce IL-2, IL-17, TNF-α (pro-inflammatory cytokines)

4. **B-cell licensure and donor-specific antibodies (DSA):**
   - Activated CD4+ helper cells provide critical signals to B cells via CD40-CD40L interaction
   - B cells specific for donor HLA receive T-cell help
   - Germinal centers form; B cells undergo somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation
   - Long-lived memory B cells and plasma cells develop
   - Result: Persistent or newly-formed (de novo) donor-specific antibodies

**Critical concept:** Indirect allorecognition is difficult to suppress with standard immunosuppression (which primarily targets direct pathway early post-transplant). This explains why chronic rejection continues despite adequate maintenance immunosuppression[1].

### 2.2 Donor-Specific Antibodies in Chronic Rejection

#### Pre-existing DSA
Recipients with pre-transplant donor-specific antibodies (usually from prior sensitization: transfusion, pregnancy, prior transplant) are at significantly elevated risk of chronic AMR and graft loss[1]:
- Increased progressive GFR decline (GFR slope -5 to -10 mL/min/year vs. -2 mL/min/year in DSA-negative)
- Graft loss at 5 years: 40-60% vs. 10-20% in DSA-negative
- Risk stratified by:
  - DSA specificity (HLA Class II > Class I)
  - DSA levels (MFI, antibody titers)
  - IgG subclass (IgG1, IgG3 more pathogenic)
  - Complement-fixing ability

#### De Novo DSA (dnDSA)
Development of new DSA post-transplant, despite lack of pre-transplant antibodies. Occurs in 25-50% of recipients by 5 years[1]:

**Risk factors for dnDSA:**
- Higher HLA mismatch degree (Class II mismatches particularly)
- Higher eplet mismatch load
- Non-adherence to immunosuppression (most common modifiable risk factor)
- Acute cellular rejection episodes (increase graft HLA expression)
- Reduced immunosuppression intensity
- Male gender (relative)
- Younger age at transplantation
- Peritoneal dialysis (vs. hemodialysis)
- Pregnancy/parity (in female recipients)

**Dynamics of dnDSA:**
- Can appear as early as 1-2 years or develop late (>5 years post-transplant)
- Early appearance often associated with worse outcomes
- Some recipients develop high-titer, persistent dnDSA; others develop low-level or transient dnDSA
- Presence of dnDSA increases risk of graft failure 3-4×

### 2.3 T-Cell Mechanisms in Chronic Rejection

#### T-Cell Exhaustion and Dysfunction
Paradoxically, T-cell exhaustion may contribute to chronic rejection:
- **Chronic antigen stimulation** in the post-transplant microenvironment drives repeated T-cell activation
- T cells upregulate inhibitory receptors: PD-1 (programmed death-1), TIM-3, LAG-3, CTLA-4
- These exhausted T cells produce high levels of pro-fibrotic cytokines: TNF-α, IL-17, IFN-γ
- Despite reduced proliferative capacity, exhausted T cells maintain inflammatory function

#### Regulatory T Cells (Tregs) Dysfunction
Tregs (CD4+CD25+Foxp3+) are critical for transplant tolerance. In chronic rejection:
- Tregs are present but functionally impaired
- Reduced production of suppressive cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β)
- Tregs may differentiate into pro-inflammatory Th17 cells (Treg plasticity)
- Imbalance between Tregs and effector T cells favors chronic inflammation

#### Macrophage Infiltration and Fibrosis
- M1 macrophages (pro-inflammatory, "classically activated") infiltrate chronically rejecting grafts
- Produce TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12 → sustain inflammation
- Transition to M2 phenotype (pro-fibrotic, "alternatively activated") with TGF-β production
- TGF-β drives fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition → IFTA (interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy)

### 2.4 Complement Activation and Chronic AMR

#### C3 and C5 Fragments as Danger Signals
Even sub-lytic complement activation (incomplete MAC formation) perpetuates inflammation[1]:
- C3a and C5a: Powerful chemoattractants for neutrophils, macrophages
- C3b and iC3b: Opsonins; enhance phagocytosis and antigen presentation
- Complement receptors (CR1, CR2) on B cells enhance B-cell responses

#### C4d Deposition
C4d (component of classical and lectin complement pathways) is a marker of complement activation in capillaries. Persistent C4d deposition in peritubular capillaries (PTC-C4d) indicates ongoing antibody-complement interactions and predicts:
- Higher risk of GFR decline
- Higher risk of graft loss
- Often associated with transplant glomerulopathy (TG)

#### Transplant Glomerulopathy (TG)
TG is a specific pattern of glomerular injury seen in chronic AMR:
- **Pathology:** GBM double contours ("spike-and-dome" appearance on electron microscopy); splits in GBM (new collagen IV deposition)
- **Mechanism:** Subendothelial immune complex deposition and complement activation → endothelial damage and GBM remodeling
- **Clinical correlation:** Associated with proteinuria, hematuria, progressive renal dysfunction
- **Strong predictor:** GFR decline and graft failure

## 3. CHRONIC ALLOGRAFT VASCULOPATHY (CAV)

### 3.1 Definition and Pathology

**Chronic allograft vasculopathy (CAV)** is progressive, concentric intimal thickening of graft vasculature resulting in luminal narrowing. Histologically:

- **Concentric intimal hyperplasia:** Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) proliferate and migrate from the media to the intima
- **Atherosclerotic-like lesions:** SMCs produce extracellular matrix (collagen, proteoglycans); foam cells accumulate; lipid deposition occurs
- **Differs from native atherosclerosis:** Non-lipid laden in early stages; distributed throughout vessel (diffuse) vs. focal native CAD; affects entire graft vasculature (systemic)
- **Progressive:** Lesions develop and progress over months to years; initially may not significantly obstruct flow but eventually cause severe stenosis

### 3.2 Organ-Specific Manifestations

#### Heart Transplant: Coronary Allograft Vasculopathy (CAV)
- **Incidence:** 5-10% per year (25-50% by 5 years); leading cause of late graft failure
- **Clinical presentation:** Often silent (denervated heart); manifests as:
  - Graft dysfunction (ejection fraction decline)
  - Acute infarction (can be fatal)
  - Arrhythmia
  - Sudden cardiac death
- **Diagnosis:** Coronary angiography (reference standard, though limited spatial resolution for distal disease); IVUS (intravascular ultrasound); OCT (optical coherence tomography); stress testing (limited sensitivity due to denervation)
- **Treatment:** Limited options; statins, ACE-I, aggressive risk factor management; repeat transplant (if recurs, worse outcomes)

#### Kidney Transplant: Renal Allograft Vasculopathy (RAV)
- **Incidence:** 5-15% clinically; may be higher on biopsy
- **Presentations:**
  - Progressive renal artery stenosis → hypertension, graft dysfunction
  - Glomerulosclerosis from ischemia
  - Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy from chronic ischemia
- **Diagnosis:** Ultrasound Doppler (resistive index elevated), CT/MR angiography, renal artery angiography with stenosis measurement
- **Treatment:** Angioplasty ± stent if significant stenosis; angiotensin inhibitors to slow progression

#### Liver Transplant: Hepatic Artery Stenosis/Thrombosis
- **Occurs in:** 5-12% of recipients (higher in pediatric, living donor)
- **Presentation:** Allograft dysfunction, elevated transaminases, jaundice (cholestasis), cholangitis
- **Diagnosis:** Doppler ultrasound, CT angiography, hepatic angiography
- **Treatment:** Angioplasty ± stent; retransplantation if irreversible liver failure

#### Lung Transplant: Chronic Rejection Phenotypes
- **Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS):** Small airway obliteration by fibrous tissue
- **Restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS):** Decline in spirometry with evidence of restrictive pattern
- Both are forms of chronic rejection; vasculopathy contributes through parenchymal ischemia

### 3.3 Mechanisms of Vasculopathy Development

#### Endothelial Injury and Activation
1. **Initial insult:**
   - Ischemia-reperfusion injury (cold storage, warm ischemia)
   - Immunologic injury (acute rejection, antibody-mediated)
   - Infection (CMV, others)

2. **Endothelial activation:**
   - Expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, P-selectin)
   - Increased vascular permeability
   - Release of pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1)
   - Prothrombotic state (tissue factor, reduced prostacyclin, increased PAI-1)

3. **Endothelial dysfunction:**
   - Reduced nitric oxide (NO) production → loss of vasodilation, increased thrombosis
   - Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production → oxidative stress
   - Impaired repair mechanisms

#### Smooth Muscle Cell Proliferation and Migration
- **Growth factors involved:** PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor), bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor), IGF-1
- **Cytokines:** TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6 stimulate SMC proliferation
- **Mechanism:** SMCs lose contractile phenotype; gain synthetic phenotype
- **Migration:** SMCs migrate from medial layer into intimal space
- **Proliferation:** Rapid clonal expansion (monoclonal or oligoclonal in early lesions; oligoclonal in established lesions)

#### Extracellular Matrix Deposition
- SMCs produce collagen (types I, III, V), proteoglycans
- Matrix accumulation in intimal space
- Contributes to lesion size and rigidity
- Results in progressive luminal narrowing

#### Macrophage and Lymphocyte Infiltration
- Foam cells (lipid-laden macrophages) accumulate in lesions
- T cells and B cells present (though lesser role than native atherosclerosis)
- Produce cytokines perpetuating SMC activation and matrix deposition

#### Immune Complexes and Complement
- Circulating immune complexes deposit in vessel walls
- Complement activation (C3a, C5a) recruits inflammatory cells
- C3 fragments enhance macrophage activation
- Membrane attack complex may cause focal endothelial damage

### 3.4 Risk Factors for CAV

**Immunologic risk factors:**
- HLA mismatch (stronger association with Class II and high eplet mismatch)
- Pre-existing or de novo DSA (particularly HLA-DR mismatches)
- Acute rejection episodes (each episode increases CAV risk ~50%)
- CMV seropositivity (especially CMV mismatch: D+R−)

**Non-immunologic risk factors:**
- Older donor age (>50 years)
- Prolonged cold ischemia time (>6-8 hours for heart; >24 hours for kidney)
- Delayed graft function (kidney)
- Hypertension (not controlled; target <130/80 mmHg)
- Dyslipidemia (elevated LDL, low HDL)
- Obesity (BMI >30)
- Smoking
- Diabetes mellitus (pre-existing or post-transplant)
- Metabolic syndrome
- Reduced immunosuppression (paradoxically; insufficient CNI levels increase both rejection and CAV)

## 4. PREVENTION AND SLOWING PROGRESSION OF CHRONIC REJECTION

### 4.1 Immunologic Strategies

#### Optimal Induction Immunosuppression
- Prevents acute rejection (risk factor for chronic rejection)
- Lymphocyte-depleting agents (rATG, alemtuzumab) more effective than non-depleting for preventing chronic rejection
- Timing and intensity balanced against infection risk

#### Maintenance Immunosuppression Optimization
- **CNI target levels:** Adequate (not excessive) CNI levels needed
  - Insufficient CNI: Increased rejection, CAV risk
  - Excessive CNI: Nephrotoxicity, interstitial fibrosis
  - Narrow therapeutic window
  
- **Antimetabolites:** MPA dosing ≥1-1.5 g daily associated with reduced rejection risk
  
- **Corticosteroids:** 
  - Early steroid withdrawal increases chronic rejection risk
  - Minimization to 5-7.5 mg daily reasonable; avoid complete discontinuation
  
- **mTOR inhibitors (sirolimus, everolimus):**
  - May reduce CAV risk vs. CNI-based regimens
  - Concern: Delayed wound healing, impaired renal function recovery
  - Role in conversion from CNI (controversial; some studies show benefit, others neutral)

#### Monitoring for De Novo DSA
- **Serial DSA testing:** Recommended at 1, 3, 6, 12 months then annually
- **Early intervention:** If dnDSA detected, consider:
  - Immunosuppression intensification
  - Consideration of plasmapheresis/IVIG if high-titer
  - Additional IVIG maintenance (annual or semi-annual)
  - Emerging agents (tocilizumab, bortezomib, complement inhibitors)

#### Preventing Non-Adherence
- **Medication non-adherence** is the strongest modifiable risk factor for dnDSA and chronic rejection
- Strategies:
  - Patient education (emphasize lifelong need)
  - Simplified regimens (once-daily dosing preferred over BID/TID)
  - Mobile health reminders
  - Regular clinic visits
  - Psychosocial support
  - Directly observed therapy (in high-risk populations)

### 4.2 Non-Immunologic Prevention Strategies

#### Cardiovascular Risk Factor Management
- **Hypertension:** Target <130/80 mmHg; use ACE-I/ARB (also reduce proteinuria)
- **Dyslipidemia:** 
  - Statins recommended for all post-transplant (reduce CAV, cardiovascular events)
  - Goal LDL <70 mg/dL
  - Add ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitor if LDL not at goal
  
- **Smoking cessation:** Mandatory; increases CAV risk 2-3×; pharmacotherapy + counseling
  
- **Diabetes management:** Tight glycemic control; target HbA1c <7%
  
- **Weight management:** BMI <30; Mediterranean diet
  
- **Physical activity:** Encourage regular aerobic and resistance exercise

#### Graft Preservation and Ischemia Minimization
- **Cold ischemia time minimization:** <12 hours preferred (each additional 6 hours increases chronic rejection risk)
- **Machine perfusion:** Emerging technology; HOPE (hypothermic oxygenated perfusion) may reduce IRI and CAV risk (more data needed)
- **Procuring high-quality organs:** Select younger, hemodynamically stable donors when possible

#### Infection Prevention and Management
- **CMV prevention:**
  - Prophylaxis (valganciclovir) if D+R− or high-risk
  - Monitoring and pre-emptive treatment if DNAemia detected
  - CMV disease increases CAV risk
  
- **Other viral infections:** Prompt diagnosis and treatment (EBV, polyomavirus, others)

#### Proteinuria Reduction
- **ACE-I/ARB:** First-line for reducing proteinuria (and hypertension)
- **Target:** Urine protein <1 g/day
- **Mechanism:** Proteinuria is marker of ongoing graft injury; reduction protective

## 5. DIAGNOSIS AND MONITORING

### 5.1 Clinical Diagnosis

**Typical presentation:**
- Gradual rise in serum creatinine over months to years
- Rate: Usually 0.1-0.3 mg/dL per month (slower than acute rejection)
- Associated: Proteinuria (often nephrotic range), hypertension, edema

**Differential diagnosis considerations:**
- **Recurrent renal disease** (GN, FSGS, IgAN)
- **CNI toxicity** (acute tubular necrosis, IFTA without rejection)
- **De novo kidney disease** (diabetes, hypertension)
- **Renal artery stenosis** (if vascular form dominant)
- **Obstruction** (ureteral stenosis, leak)

### 5.2 Diagnostic Approach

**Laboratory:**
- Serum creatinine, calculated GFR
- Electrolytes, phosphorus
- Proteinuria quantification (24-hour urine or protein-to-creatinine ratio)
- DSA testing (single-antigen bead Luminex)
- Complement components (C3, C4) if C4d+ biopsy
- dd-cfDNA (emerging biomarker for chronic AMR; elevation >1% concerning)

**Imaging:**
- Renal ultrasound with Doppler (assess for stenosis; resistive index)
- If vascular suspected: CT/MR angiography or angiography

**Tissue biopsy (Gold standard):**
- Indication: Progressive GFR decline without other explanation
- Light microscopy: IFTA, vasculopathy, glomerulosclerosis, CAN
- Immunofluorescence: C4d, immunoglobulins
- Electron microscopy: GBM double contours (transplant glomerulopathy), basement membrane thinning, others
- Banff classification: CTM-R vs. CAM-R vs. non-rejection IFTA vs. combination

## 6. TREATMENT OF ESTABLISHED CHRONIC REJECTION

**Unfortunately, no proven reversals of established chronic rejection.** Management focuses on slowing progression:

1. **Optimize maintenance immunosuppression**
   - Ensure adequate CNI levels
   - Maximize antimetabolite dosing
   - Continue corticosteroids at reasonable maintenance dose

2. **Reduce non-immunologic drivers**
   - Intensive BP control
   - Lipid management
   - Smoking cessation
   - Proteinuria reduction

3. **Monitor and intervene early**
   - Serial DSA testing; if rise, consider above strategies
   - Monitor GFR slope; if accelerating, biopsy to guide therapy

4. **Consider emerging therapies** (limited data)
   - Complement inhibitors (eculizumab, C3-directed agents)
   - Belatacept (costimulation blockade) in selected cases
   - Tocilizumab (IL-6 antagonist)

5. **Plan for renal replacement therapy or retransplantation**
   - Prepare for eventual graft failure
   - Discuss timing of return to dialysis vs. preemptive retransplantation

---

## 7. SUMMARY AND KEY CONCEPTS

1. **Chronic rejection is progressive graft loss** driven by ongoing indirect alloimmunization (T-cell and B-cell mediated), non-immunologic factors, and complement activation.

2. **De novo DSA development** is common (25-50% by 5 years) and a major risk factor for chronic AMR and graft loss; early detection and intervention critical.

3. **Indirect allorecognition** (not effectively suppressed by standard early post-transplant immunosuppression) becomes dominant driver over time.

4. **Chronic allograft vasculopathy** (CAV) is hallmark pathology—concentric intimal thickening from SMC proliferation, matrix deposition, and inflammatory cell infiltration.

5. **Prevention better than treatment:** Preventing acute rejection, maintaining adherence, HLA matching optimization, non-adherence prevention, and cardiovascular risk factor management are key.

6. **No proven reversal:** Treatment focuses on slowing progression through maintenance immunosuppression optimization and cardiovascular risk reduction.
