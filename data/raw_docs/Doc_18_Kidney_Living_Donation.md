# DOCUMENT 18: KIDNEY TRANSPLANT - LIVING DONATION IN-DEPTH AND ALTRUISTIC PROGRAMS

## Executive Summary

Living kidney donation represents the gold standard for transplantation, with superior graft survival and extended preservation window compared to deceased donation. Modern living donation encompasses traditional family-related donation, unrelated living donors, paired kidney exchange programs enabling immunologically incompatible pairs to exchange partners, and altruistic donation initiating donation chains. This document comprehensively addresses living donor selection and evaluation, the comprehensive informed consent process, outcomes compared to deceased donation, and contemporary living donation programs including paired exchange and altruistic donor chains.

## 1. LIVING DONOR EVALUATION AND SELECTION

### 1.1 Donor-Recipient Relationship

**Living related donors:**
- Biologically related to recipient (parent, sibling, child, grandparent, etc.)
- Genetic similarity enhances HLA matching probability
- Family emotional ties may facilitate donation

**Living unrelated donors:**
- Spouse, friend, or other relationship
- Growing population (now ~40% of living donors)
- Same medical evaluation as related donors
- HLA matching generally less favorable (no genetic relationship)

**Altruistic (non-directed) donors:**
- Donate without identified recipient
- Chain initiation; allow incompatible pairs to exchange
- Special psychosocial evaluation (ensure true altruism, no coercion)
- Growing numbers (500+ annually in US)

### 1.2 Medical Evaluation (KDIGO 2017 Standard)

**Absolute contraindications to donation:**
- Significant renal disease (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m²): Not donors
- Diabetes mellitus (especially Type 1, poorly controlled): Relative; individualize
- Significant hypertension (>140/90 mmHg uncontrolled): Requires control before clearance
- Proteinuria (>300 mg/day or albuminuria >30 mg/g): Workup needed; reconsider if persistent
- Hematuria (macroscopic): Urologic evaluation required
- Active infection (UTI, other): Treat first
- Malignancy: Depends on type/remission status; defer donation if active or recent
- Significant cardiovascular disease: CAD, prior MI, cardiomyopathy: Individualize; optimize first
- Liver disease: Depends on severity; cirrhosis contraindication
- Thrombophilia or coagulopathy: Individualize; may increase operative bleeding risk
- HIV/Hepatitis B/C: May donate to concordant recipient; requires informed consent/ID consultation

**Relative contraindications (assess individually):**
- Age >60 years (vs. <50 years optimal; increased operative/long-term risk)
- Obesity (BMI >35 kg/m²): Surgical complications increased; weight loss encouraged
- Solitary kidney (congenital or prior nephrectomy): Contraindication
- Uncontrolled psychiatric illness: Psychosocial clearance required
- Active substance abuse: Reconsider; sobriety prerequisite
- Significant socioeconomic hardship: Financial counseling; address barriers to recovery

### 1.3 Comprehensive Evaluation Components

**Laboratory assessment:**

| Test | Normal | Action if Abnormal |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| **eGFR** | >60 mL/min/1.73m² | eGFR 45-59: further evaluate; <45: reconsider |
| **Creatinine** | Normal age-appropriate | Abnormal: evaluate for renal disease |
| **BUN** | Normal | Abnormal: assess hydration, renal function |
| **Electrolytes (Na, K, Cl, HCO3)** | Normal | Abnormal: evaluate cause; correct pre-donation |
| **Glucose (fasting)** | <100 mg/dL | 100-125: impaired fasting glucose; >126: diabetes |
| **Lipids** | Desirable | Abnormal: discuss risk; not contraindication |
| **Liver enzymes** | Normal | Abnormal: evaluate; cirrhosis → contraindication |
| **Coagulation (PT/INR, PTT)** | Normal | Abnormal: evaluate for bleeding disorder |
| **CBC** | Normal | Anemia: evaluate; thrombocytopenia: assess |
| **Urinalysis** | Normal | Protein/RBC: 24-hr urine protein collection |
| **24-hr urine protein** | <150 mg/day | >300 mg/day: reconsider; investigate proteinuria |
| **Urine culture** | Negative | Positive: treat UTI; reculture post-treatment |
| **Blood pressure** | <140/90 mmHg | >140/90: treat to goal; monitor pre-donation |

**Serologic testing:**

| Serology | Desirable | If Positive |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **HIV** | Negative | Relative contraindication; specialized centers can proceed if recipient also HIV+ |
| **HBsAg (HBV)** | Negative | Relative; antiviral prophylaxis if donor+, recipient−; specialist consultation |
| **Anti-HBc, anti-HBs** | Immune or vaccinated | Not contraindication; assess immunity |
| **Anti-HCV (HCV)** | Negative | Relative; RNA viral load; coordinate with ID; direct-acting antivirals available |
| **RPR/TPPA (syphilis)** | Negative | Treat if positive; neurosyphilis workup if symptomatic |
| **Strongyloides serology** | Negative | Treat if positive (ivermectin) before donation |
| **TB (IGRA or TST)** | Negative | If positive: rule out active TB; treat LTBI if needed |
| **CMV serology** | Variable | Not contraindication; donor CMV status noted for recipient management |
| **EBV serology** | Variable | Not contraindication; noted for recipient (especially if recipient EBV-negative) |

**Imaging studies:**
- **Ultrasound of kidneys:** Assess size, echogenicity, hydronephrosis, masses
  - Should be: Normal size (9-13 cm), normal echogenicity, no hydronephrosis
  - Abnormal: Cysts (if simple <2-3 cm acceptable; complex concerning), atrophy, stones, tumors → contraindication

- **Renal artery duplex (Doppler) ultrasound or CT angiography:**
  - Essential to assess vascular anatomy
  - Identify: Single artery (easiest surgery) vs. multiple arteries (more complex but not contraindication)
  - Stenosis: Rule out significant renal artery stenosis
  - Aneurysm: Rare; if found, vascular surgery consultation

- **ECG and chest X-ray:** Baseline; indicated if cardiovascular risk factors

**Cardiovascular evaluation (risk-stratified):**
- **Low risk** (age <50, no CAD risk factors): ECG and chest X-ray
- **Intermediate risk** (age 50-70 or cardiac risk factors): Stress test (treadmill, pharmacologic, or imaging)
- **High risk** (age >70, prior CAD, multiple risk factors): Coronary angiography or CTA

### 1.4 Psychosocial Evaluation

**Mandatory psychosocial assessment by independent team (separate from transplant surgical/medical team):**

**Components:**

| Area | Assessment | Goal |
|------|-----------|------|
| **Motivation** | Why donate? Understand reasons | Altruistic motivation; not coerced |
| **Relationship** | Dynamics with recipient | Appropriate boundary; relationship healthy |
| **Mental health** | History of psychiatric illness, current status | Stable; under treatment if needed; no contraindications |
| **Coping skills** | How handle stress, problem-solve | Adequate; support systems identified |
| **Understanding** | Comprehend risks, benefits, alternatives | Informed; realistic expectations |
| **Autonomy** | Free to decide; no coercion | Independent choice; time to decide |
| **Support system** | Family, social support post-surgery | Adequate support for recovery |
| **Financial barriers** | Can afford to miss work, travel to appointments? | Address barriers; financial counseling if needed |
| **Health literacy** | Understand medical information? | Education provided; verified comprehension |

**Red flags requiring caution:**
- Donor under pressure from family/recipient
- Donor doesn't understand risks
- Donor has unrealistic expectations ("cure" recipient)
- Donor has active psychiatric illness (untreated)
- Donor has history of substance abuse (not in stable recovery)
- Financial desperation motivating decision (organ trafficking concern)

**Psychological support:**
- Counseling before surgery (address anxiety, expectations)
- Support groups (connect with other donors)
- Post-operative counseling (process any grief, regret, etc.)

## 2. INFORMED CONSENT FOR LIVING DONATION

### 2.1 Core Elements

**Informed consent must include (legally/ethically):**

1. **Purpose:** Explain kidney donation, transplantation, how it helps recipient
2. **Risks (surgical and medical):**
   - **Operative mortality:** ~1 per 10,000 (0.01%) for open nephrectomy; <0.01% for laparoscopic
   - **Major morbidity:** Infection (1-5%), bleeding (1-2%), hematoma (5-10%), DVT/PE (0.5-1%)
   - **Pain/discomfort:** Post-operative pain for weeks; occasionally chronic pain (0.5-1%)
   - **Wound complications:** Infection, dehiscence, hernia (2-5%)
   - **Anesthesia risks:** Aspiration, cardiac, respiratory complications (rare; ~0.1%)

3. **Long-term renal health:**
   - **GFR decline:** ~25% initial decline; then slow decline (similar to general population aging)
   - **Hypertension:** 50% develop HTN (vs. 40% general population); multifactorial; not solely from donation
   - **Proteinuria:** Rare; monitor if occurs
   - **ESRD risk:** Estimated 1 in 200 donors over lifetime (vs. 1 in 3000 general population)
     - Higher risk: Pre-existing HTN, DM, obesity, African American race, age >60 at donation
   - **Pregnancy:** Slightly increased preeclampsia risk (2-3×); otherwise safe

4. **Alternatives:**
   - Recipient continues dialysis
   - Recipient waits for deceased donor
   - Recipient pursues desensitization/paired exchange (if incompatible)

5. **Right to withdraw:**
   - Donor can change mind at ANY time before surgery
   - No penalty; relationship should not be affected
   - Can decline surgery day-of without explanation

6. **Confidentiality and privacy:**
   - Medical information kept confidential
   - Donation status private (share only if donor chooses)

### 2.2 Consent Process

**Documentation:**
- Written informed consent document (reviewed, discussed, signed)
- Witnessed signature (in most jurisdictions)
- Independent legal counsel option (especially unrelated donors)
- Copy provided to donor

**Timing:**
- Discussion occurs at least days-weeks before surgery (not rushed)
- Opportunity for donor to ask questions
- Cooling-off period in some protocols (especially altruistic donors)

## 3. LIVING DONATION OUTCOMES

### 3.1 Graft Survival

**Outcomes superior to deceased donation:**

| Outcome | Living Donor | Deceased Donor | Difference |
|---------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| **1-year graft survival** | 98% | 95% | +3% |
| **5-year graft survival** | 90-95% | 85% | +5-10% |
| **10-year graft survival** | 80-90% | 70-75% | +10-15% |
| **Median graft survival (half-life)** | 18-20 years | 12-15 years | +5-8 years |

**Reasons for superior outcomes:**
- Shorter cold ischemia time (planned surgery; minimal ischemia)
- Better HLA matching (especially related donors)
- Healthier donor organs (living donors screened; no brain death injury)
- Recipient better prepared (planned surgery; optimization possible)

### 3.2 Patient Survival

**Outcomes:**
- Living transplant recipients: 10-year survival ~90% (age-adjusted)
- Equivalent to or better than deceased donor (slightly shorter ischemia time)
- Related to: Pre-transplant comorbidities, age, race, other factors; not donation type

## 4. PAIRED KIDNEY EXCHANGE (PKE) AND CHAINS

### 4.1 Traditional Paired Exchange

**Mechanism:**
- Donor-recipient pair A: Donor incompatible with their recipient (usually ABO or HLA)
- Donor-recipient pair B: Donor incompatible with their recipient
- **Exchange:** Donor A's kidney → Recipient B; Donor B's kidney → Recipient A
- Both recipients now compatible; both transplants proceed

**Example (ABO-incompatible pairs):**
- Pair A: Type O donor (wants to give to Type B recipient - incompatible)
- Pair B: Type B donor (wants to give to Type O recipient - incompatible)
- Exchange: O kidney → Type O recipient (Pair B); B kidney → Type B recipient (Pair A)

**Immunologic workup:**
- ABO compatibility verified
- HLA matching assessed (virtual crossmatch)
- DSA tested (crossmatch negative required)
- Careful typing/testing to ensure true compatibility after exchange

**Logistics:**
- Coordinated operative scheduling (same operating rooms, same day if possible)
- If Donor A has complication, Donor B's surgery can be cancelled (recipient priority)
- Legal contracts specifying terms (what happens if donor unavailable, etc.)

### 4.2 Extended Matching and Chains

**Extended matching (>2 pairs):**
- Multiple pairs enrolled
- Matching algorithm identifies optimal exchanges
- Example: 4-way exchange with multiple ABO/HLA incompatibilities resolved

**Donor chains:**
- Altruistic donor initiates chain
- Altruistic donor gives to most-difficult-to-match recipient
- That recipient's paired donor gives to next most-difficult recipient
- Chain continues (2-5+ recipients in longest chains)

**Advantages of chains:**
- Expands options for highly sensitized recipients
- Allows incompatible pairs who wouldn't otherwise match to transplant
- Altruistic donor motivation: Contributes to multiple transplants

**Challenges:**
- Logistics complex (multiple pairs, surgeries)
- Legal/ethical considerations (what if donor withdraws mid-chain?)
- Informed consent detailed (must understand chain dynamics)

### 4.3 Outcomes in PKE

**Graft survival:**
- Similar to traditional living donation (excellent; 90-95% at 5 years)
- HLA matching may be less optimal (compatible match prioritized over best match)
- Overall excellent outcomes

**Patient satisfaction:**
- High satisfaction in all matched pairs
- Altruistic donor often experiences fulfillment from enabling chain

## 5. ALTRUISTIC (NON-DIRECTED) DONATION

### 5.1 Definition and Epidemiology

**Definition:** Living donor donates without prior relationship to specific recipient

**Epidemiology:**
- ~500-600 altruistic donations annually (US)
- Growing trend (especially with media attention, public awareness)
- Young-to-middle-aged donors typically
- Higher education level often

**Motivations:**
- Genuine altruism ("help someone in need")
- Religious/philosophical beliefs ("pay it forward")
- Life experience (personal loss, spiritual calling)
- Media exposure (publicized cases inspire)

### 5.2 Psychosocial Evaluation (Enhanced)

**More rigorous than related/unrelated donors:**

**Areas emphasized:**
- **True altruism:** Not seeking recognition, payment, or benefit
- **Autonomy:** Not coerced; independent decision
- **Stability:** Psychiatric stability confirmed
- **Understanding:** Fully comprehends risks, unknowns (doesn't know recipient; cannot meet)
- **Motivation:** Deep reflection on "why" donate
- **Expectations:** Realistic (may never know recipient; no guarantee of gratitude)
- **Support system:** Adequate (may not have family involvement in decision)

**Red flags:**
- Donor seeks payment or recognition
- Donor expects something in return
- Donor expects to meet recipient (not standard model)
- Donor has unstable housing, finances (may indicate desperation)
- Donor has recent psychiatric diagnosis (monitor stability)

### 5.3 Recipient Selection for Altruistic Donation

**Ethical allocation:**
- **OPTN policy:** Altruistic kidney allocated according to standard allocation rules
- **Recipient selection:** Not influenced by donor preference; random/lottery component often used
- **Fairness:** Highest-need recipient (OPTN allocation algorithm) or randomized among eligible

**Recipient notification:**
- Recipient knows organ is from altruistic donor (not deceased donor)
- Recipient may or may not choose to contact donor (policies vary)
- Anonymity respected if either party requests

### 5.4 Chain Outcomes and Ethics

**Outcomes:**
- Graft survival: Excellent (similar to traditional living donation)
- Patient satisfaction: Very high

**Ethical considerations:**
- **Exploitation prevention:** Screening prevents financial desperation/trafficking
- **Autonomy protection:** Independent evaluation assures true choice
- **Public trust:** Altruistic donation enhances trust in system
- **Justice:** Allocation fair (highest-need recipients prioritized)

## 6. LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP OF LIVING DONORS

### 6.1 Post-Operative Monitoring

**Immediate post-operative:**
- Pain management
- Wound care
- Ambulation
- Discharge criteria met before sending home

**3-6 months post-operative:**
- Return visit to surgeon (wound healing, physical recovery)
- Labs: Serum creatinine, urinalysis
- Assess: Any complications, pain, concerns

**Annual follow-up (lifelong):**
- **Blood pressure:** Monitor for HTN development
- **Renal function:** Serum creatinine, eGFR, urinalysis
- **Health screening:** Age-appropriate (cancer, CV disease, others)
- **Lifestyle counseling:** Exercise, healthy diet, avoid smoking, limit NSAIDs

### 6.2 Psychological Follow-Up

**Post-operative course:**
- Some donors experience joy/fulfillment
- Some donors experience regret/grief (especially if recipient has poor outcomes)
- Some donors experience isolation (if not well supported)

**Support:**
- Access to counseling if needed
- Peer support groups (connect with other donors)
- Ongoing relationship with transplant team (available for questions)
- Contact with recipient (if both parties consent)

### 6.3 Financial Protections

**US protections:**
- National Kidney Foundation covers medical evaluation costs
- Medicare/insurance covers surgery + post-operative care
- NOTA (National Organ Transplant Act) provides some protections against financial coercion

**Challenges:**
- Lost wages: Donor may miss work 4-6 weeks
- Disability: Temporary unable to work
- Financial assistance: May be available through nonprofit organizations

**International context:**
- Varies by country (some provide payment, others prohibition)
- WHO recommends: Protections against exploitation; altruism encouraged
