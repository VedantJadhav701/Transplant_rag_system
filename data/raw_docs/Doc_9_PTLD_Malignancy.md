# DOCUMENT 9: POST-TRANSPLANT MALIGNANCY - PTLD AND SOLID TUMORS

## Executive Summary

Malignancy is a major cause of long-term morbidity and mortality after solid organ transplantation, encompassing post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD)—a potentially lethal complication strongly associated with EBV and intensity of immunosuppression—and a spectrum of solid tumors (skin cancers, renal, hepatic, lung, and others) occurring at rates 2-200× higher than the general population depending on organ type and tumor category. This document comprehensively addresses PTLD pathogenesis, classification, diagnosis, and management strategies, as well as post-transplant solid tumor epidemiology, risk factors, surveillance strategies, and prevention approaches.

## 1. POST-TRANSPLANT LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDER (PTLD)

### 1.1 Definition and Epidemiology

**Definition:** PTLD is a lymphoid proliferation disorder developing after organ transplantation, ranging from early lymphoid hyperplasia to frank lymphoma (typically B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma or Hodgkin-like disease).

**Incidence by organ type:**
- Intestine: 20-30% (highest risk)
- Heart: 5-10%
- Lung: 5-10%
- Liver: 2-5% (relatively low; liver immunologically privileged)
- Kidney: 1-4%

**Risk factors for PTLD:**
- **EBV seronegative recipient (D+R−):** 5-10% risk vs. <1% in seropositive recipients
- **T-cell depleting induction:** rATG, alemtuzumab → 2-3× higher risk vs. basiliximab
- **High CNI/antimetabolite levels:** Intense immunosuppression
- **Organ type:** Intestine > Heart/Lung > Liver/Kidney
- **Age:** Pediatric recipients higher risk than adults
- **Repeated episodes of rejection:** Treated with augmented IS

### 1.2 Pathogenesis

**EBV-driven mechanism:**
- EBV infects B-lymphocytes
- Transformed B cells bypass normal apoptosis via viral oncogenes (EBNA1, LMP1)
- In immunocompetent hosts, EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) control transformed B cells
- With intense/prolonged immunosuppression, EBV-specific CTLs depleted/dysfunctional → unchecked B-cell proliferation

**Natural history:**
- Early lesions: Polyclonal B-cell proliferation (reversible with IS reduction)
- Intermediate: Polymorphic PTLD (multiple B-cell clones; partially reversible)
- Late: Monomorphic PTLD (single clone; true lymphoma; irreversible; often EBV-negative in later cases)

**Timeline:**
- Peak incidence: 6-24 months post-transplant
- Can occur years later (especially with ongoing IS or rejection episodes)
- EBV-seronegative recipients: Earlier onset (3-12 months) with more aggressive course

### 1.3 WHO Classification of PTLD

**Early lesions:**
- Plasmacytic hyperplasia, infectious mononucleosis-like lesion
- Polymorphic infiltrate; polyclonal; rarely mass-forming
- Often EBV+ and reversible with IS reduction

**Polymorphic PTLD:**
- Mixed B and T-lymphocyte infiltrate; multiple clones
- Nodal and extranodal sites possible
- Partially reversible with IS reduction
- Intermediate prognosis (30-40% mortality if untreated)

**Monomorphic PTLD:**
- Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL): 60-70% of monomorphic PTLD
- Burkitt lymphoma: 10-15%
- Hodgkin lymphoma: 10-15%
- Other T-cell lymphomas: rare
- Generally EBV-negative (especially DLBCL)
- True malignancy; requires chemotherapy

**Classic Hodgkin Lymphoma-Type PTLD:**
- Reed-Sternberg cells, Hodgkin cells
- EBV-positive
- Nodal presentation
- Similar prognosis to monomorphic PTLD

### 1.4 Clinical Presentation

**Nodal PTLD (60-70%):**
- Lymphadenopathy (cervical, mediastinal, retroperitoneal)
- Constitutional symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss)
- Dyspnea or chest pain (mediastinal nodes)

**Extranodal PTLD (30-40%):**
- **Graft involvement:** Kidney, heart, or other transplanted organ (diagnostically important)
- **GI tract:** Most common extranodal site; presents with diarrhea, abdominal pain, GI bleeding, perforation
- **CNS:** Seizures, focal deficits, altered mental status (5-10% of PTLD cases; poor prognosis)
- **Liver, marrow, skin, other organs:** Variable presentation

**Nonspecific symptoms:**
- Fever of unknown origin
- Malaise, fatigue
- May mimic infection (CMV, other opportunistic pathogens)

### 1.5 Diagnosis

**Laboratory studies:**
- **EBV PCR (quantitative):** Elevated EBV load (>100,000 copies/mL) concerning but not diagnostic
- **CBC:** Leukocytosis, atypical lymphocytosis, anemia, or thrombocytopenia
- **LFTs, renal function:** Assess organ involvement
- **Lactate dehydrogenase:** Elevated in lymphoma; prognostic marker

**Imaging:**
- **CT chest/abdomen/pelvis:** Nodal size, organ involvement, extranodal disease
- **PET-CT:** Functional imaging; avidity helps differentiate PTLD from inflammation/infection; staging
- **Endoscopy/colonoscopy:** If GI involvement suspected (obtain biopsies)

**Histopathology (mandatory for diagnosis):**
- **Biopsy:** Excision preferred; core biopsy acceptable if excision not feasible
- **Immunophenotyping:** Flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry to assess clonality (monoclonal vs. polyclonal)
- **EBV testing:** EBER in situ hybridization (quantify EBV+ cells)
- **Cytogenetics/molecular:** For monomorphic PTLD (Myc translocation in Burkitt, etc.)

**Staging (Lugano classification for lymphomas):**
- Stage I: Single nodal group or single extranodal organ
- Stage II: Multiple nodal groups or localized extranodal involvement
- Stage III: Involvement of abdomen and/or above diaphragm
- Stage IV: Diffuse involvement, marrow, CNS, or multiple extranodal sites

## 2. MANAGEMENT OF PTLD

### 2.1 First-Line Approach: Reduction of Immunosuppression (RIS)

**Rationale:** Restore EBV-specific immune control by decreasing depth of immunosuppression

**Practical steps:**
1. **CNI reduction:** Halve tacrolimus target level (from 8-10 ng/mL → 4-5 ng/mL)
2. **Antimetabolite:** Discontinue or reduce MPA dose by 50%
3. **Corticosteroids:** Minimize but maintain some coverage (rejection risk balance)
4. **Monitor:** Weekly labs initially (CBC, creatinine, LFTs); assess for rejection vs. PTLD improvement

**Efficacy:**
- Early/polymorphic PTLD: 30-50% complete response with RIS alone
- Monomorphic PTLD: <10% response to RIS alone (need chemotherapy)
- Time to response: 2-4 weeks typical

**Risk:** IS reduction → increased rejection risk (1-5% develop acute rejection); manage with close monitoring, possible biopsy

### 2.2 Rituximab Monotherapy

**Indication:** First-line systemic therapy for monomorphic PTLD or polymorphic PTLD failing RIS

**Mechanism:** Anti-CD20 antibody targeting B-cell lineage antigens

**Dosing:**
- Standard: 375 mg/m² IV weekly × 4 weeks
- Can repeat weekly (total 4-8 doses) based on response

**Monitoring:**
- CBC baseline, then before each dose
- Infusion reactions: Premedicate with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, methylprednisolone
- Reactivation of latent viruses: CMV, HBV (monitor)

**Efficacy:**
- Monomorphic PTLD: 40-60% response rate
- Polymorphic PTLD: 60-80% response rate
- Better outcomes when combined with RIS

**Toxicity:**
- Generally well tolerated
- Neutropenia (5-10%)
- Infectious complications (low rate with prophylaxis)
- Very rare: PML (JC virus reactivation)

### 2.3 Chemotherapy

**Indication:** Refractory/relapsed PTLD after rituximab, or advanced/high-grade disease at presentation

**Regimens:**
- **R-CHOP:** Rituximab + cyclophosphamide + doxorubicin + vincristine + prednisolone
  - Standard for DLBCL
  - 6-8 cycles typical
  - Efficacy: 70-80% response in immunocompetent; 50-60% in transplant recipients

- **R-EPOCH:** Rituximab + etoposide + prednisone + vincristine + cyclophosphamide + doxorubicin
  - Continuous infusion; used for high-risk cases

- **Other:** CVP, ABVD (Hodgkin), or organ-specific regimens

**Considerations:**
- CNI/IS dose reduction often continued alongside chemotherapy
- Monitoring: Frequent CBC, renal function, cardiac function (doxorubicin)
- Infectious complications: Neutropenia prophylaxis important

**Efficacy:** 50-70% complete response; variable progression-free survival

### 2.4 Other Therapies

**Surgery/Radiation:**
- Localized disease (single node, single organ): Consider excision ± radiation
- May avoid systemic chemotherapy in select cases
- Useful for GI perforation or bleeding

**Second-line chemo:**
- Salvage regimens for chemotherapy-refractory disease
- Options: ESHAP, DHAP, or others based on prior therapy

**CAR-T cell therapy (emerging):**
- Limited experience in transplant PTLD
- Promising in early reports
- Not yet standard of care

**Rare cases:** Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
- Highly experimental
- Reserved for refractory disease in fit candidates
- High transplant-related mortality in this population

### 2.5 Prognosis and Outcomes

**Favorable factors:**
- Early-stage disease (Stage I-II)
- Polymorphic or early lesion histology
- Good performance status
- No CNS involvement

**Unfavorable factors:**
- Advanced stage (Stage IV)
- CNS disease (very poor prognosis)
- Monomorphic PTLD (especially Burkitt or Hodgkin)
- Poor performance status
- High-risk IPI score

**Overall survival:**
- Early PTLD: 80-90% at 2 years
- Monomorphic PTLD: 50-60% at 2 years
- CNS PTLD: <10% at 2 years

## 3. NON-PTLD MALIGNANCIES AFTER SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANT

### 3.1 Epidemiology

**Overall malignancy incidence:**
- 2-4× higher than age-matched general population (varies by organ, immunosuppression intensity)
- Cumulative incidence at 10 years: 10-20% depending on organ

**Organ-specific cumulative incidence:**
- Intestine: 30-40%
- Heart: 20-25%
- Lung: 15-20%
- Kidney: 5-10%
- Liver: 5-10%

### 3.2 Skin Cancers (Most Common)

**Epidemiology:**
- 40-50× higher risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) vs. general population
- 10× higher risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC)
- 3-5× higher melanoma risk
- Merkel cell carcinoma: 20-40× higher

**Risk factors:**
- Duration and intensity of immunosuppression (especially CNI, higher risk than mTOR)
- UV exposure (latitude, outdoor activities)
- Age at transplantation
- Skin phototype (fair skin > dark skin)
- Prior skin cancer history

**Presentation:**
- SCC: Often in sun-exposed areas; rapid growth; can be aggressive
- BCC: Basal cell type; slower growth; rarely metastasizes
- Melanoma: Can be aggressive; early detection critical

**Management:**
- **Surveillance:** Annual full-body skin examination by dermatologist; self-examination monthly
- **Prevention:** Strict sun protection (SPF 50+, protective clothing, limited sun exposure 10 AM-4 PM)
- **Treatment:** Excision with clear margins; Mohs micrographic surgery for select SCC; consider sentinel node biopsy for melanoma
- **IS modification:** Consider mTOR inhibitor (sirolimus) conversion for recurrent skin cancers; some evidence for reduced recurrence

### 3.3 Solid Tumors (Organ-Specific)

**Renal cell carcinoma (RCC):**
- 3-6× higher incidence in transplant recipients
- Often in native kidneys (can occur in allograft)
- Risk factors: Chronic kidney disease, smoking, obesity, immunosuppression
- Presentation: Hematuria, flank pain, constitutional symptoms
- Screening: Annual ultrasound or CT (no clear benefit shown; surveillance tailored to risk)
- Management: Nephrectomy (native or allograft depending on location/size); systemic therapy for metastatic disease

**Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC):**
- High risk in liver transplant recipients with HCV or HBV
- Also occurs in non-viral liver disease
- Screening: Ultrasound ± AFP every 3-4 months in high-risk recipients
- Management: Resection, transplantation (if within Milan criteria), ablation, or systemic therapy

**Lung cancer:**
- Increased risk, especially in smokers
- Screening: Consider low-dose CT in high-risk (smokers, significant smoking history)
- Management: Standard oncologic approaches (resection, chemo, immunotherapy)

**Colorectal, breast, prostate, cervical cancer:**
- Modestly increased risk (2-3×)
- Standard age-appropriate screening applies
- Some centers recommend earlier/more frequent screening

**Virus-associated cancers:**
- **HPV-related:** Cervical, anal, oropharyngeal cancers (higher risk; aggressive)
  - Vaccination pre- or post-transplant can reduce incidence
  - Screening: Pap smear (cervix), anal cytology in high-risk
  
- **HBV-related:** HCC (in recipients with chronic HBV)
  - Screening: Ultrasound + AFP
  
- **HCV-related:** HCC (in recipients with chronic HCV)
  - Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) cure HCV; may reduce HCC risk
  
- **Kaposi sarcoma (HHV-8):** Rare in immunosuppressed non-HIV transplant recipients; more common in HIV+/HHV-8+ recipients

## 4. PREVENTION AND SURVEILLANCE

### 4.1 Pre-Transplant Screening

**Malignancy history:**
- Document prior malignancies, treatment, disease-free interval
- Most transplant programs require cancer-free waiting periods (typically 2-5 years depending on cancer type)

**Current malignancy screening:**
- Age-appropriate cancer screening (colon, breast, prostate, cervix)
- High-risk populations: Enhanced screening

### 4.2 Post-Transplant Surveillance

**First year:**
- Baseline full-body skin exam (dermatology)
- Standard cancer screening per age/risk (USPSTF guidelines apply, but often more frequent)
- Organ-specific (liver ultrasound if HCV+, renal ultrasound if RCC risk, etc.)

**Ongoing (annually):**
- Full-body skin exam
- Standard screening (mammography, colonoscopy, etc. on standard intervals)
- HPV vaccination if not prior; Gardasil 9 can be given post-transplant
- Organ-specific surveillance per protocol

### 4.3 Immunosuppression Minimization

**Strategies to reduce malignancy risk:**
- Minimize CNI dose (lower target levels after induction phase)
- Consider mTOR inhibitor conversion (sirolimus/everolimus) for recipients with skin cancer or high malignancy risk
  - Evidence stronger for skin cancer; modest benefit for solid tumors
- Minimize corticosteroid exposure (target ≤5 mg/day)
- Antimetabolite: Standard dose; no clear benefit to further reduction

### 4.4 Behavioral Interventions

- **Sun protection:** SPF 50+, protective clothing, avoid midday sun
- **Smoking cessation:** Critical for lung cancer, bladder cancer, others
- **HPV vaccination:** Offered to all unvaccinated recipients (even if prior exposure likely)
- **Weight management, exercise:** General health promotion
- **Alcohol moderation:** Reduce HCC risk, others
