# DOCUMENT 2: ACUTE REJECTION - MECHANISMS, DIAGNOSIS, AND TREATMENT

## Executive Summary

Acute rejection is an immune-mediated graft injury occurring days to months after transplantation, representing one of the most critical periods for graft preservation. It comprises two primary pathways: T-cell-mediated rejection (cellular, acute cellular rejection) and B-cell/antibody-mediated rejection (AMR). Early diagnosis through clinical suspicion and tissue biopsy, combined with aggressive immunosuppressive therapy, is essential to prevent progression to chronic rejection and irreversible graft loss. This document synthesizes mechanisms of acute rejection, diagnostic approaches, and evidence-based treatment strategies across solid organ transplantation.

## 1. EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS

### 1.1 Incidence

Acute rejection remains one of the most common complications following solid organ transplantation, though rates have declined dramatically over the past two decades[1]:

- **Kidney transplantation**: 10-25% incidence within the first year (declined from ~50% in 1980s)
- **Liver transplantation**: 20-40% of recipients experience biopsy-proven acute rejection
- **Heart transplantation**: 30-50% in first year, with later episodes possible
- **Lung transplantation**: 40-50% within first year; acute rejection is the leading cause of death beyond the immediate perioperative period
- **Pancreas transplantation**: 10-15% of recipients

The dramatic reduction in acute rejection rates results from advances in induction immunosuppression and maintenance regimen optimization.

### 1.2 Timing and Clinical Presentation

**Timing of acute rejection:**
- Highest risk in the immediate post-operative period through the first 3 months
- Can occur at any point in the post-transplant course
- Early acute rejection (within 3 months) is more common than late acute rejection (>1 year)
- Risk remains elevated throughout the recipient's lifetime

**Risk factors for acute rejection:**
1. **Immunologic factors:**
   - HLA mismatch burden (especially Class II and eplet mismatches)
   - Pre-existing donor-specific antibodies (DSA)
   - Higher calculated panel reactive antibody (PRA/cPRA)
   - Prior transplantation
   - African American race/ethnicity (associated with higher rejection rates)

2. **Graft factors:**
   - Prolonged cold ischemia time (>24 hours; 13% increase in risk vs. <12 hours)
   - Delayed graft function (major risk factor for subsequent acute rejection)
   - Extended criteria donor organs
   - Older donor age (relative effect)

3. **Recipient factors:**
   - Non-adherence to immunosuppressive medications
   - Younger age at transplantation
   - Male gender (relative)
   - Presence of infections

4. **Therapy factors:**
   - Induction immunosuppression type (non-depleting agents carry higher risk)
   - Maintenance immunosuppression regimen
   - Reduction or discontinuation of immunosuppression

## 2. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF ACUTE REJECTION

### 2.1 T-Cell-Mediated Rejection (Acute Cellular Rejection)

T-cell-mediated rejection is orchestrated by CD4+ helper T cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) recognizing donor antigens through three distinct allorecognition pathways.

#### Direct Allorecognition

**Mechanism:**
Recipient T cells directly recognize intact donor HLA molecules (both Class I and II) displayed on donor antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that persist in the transplanted organ. This results in:
- Very high frequency of alloreactive T cells (0.1-10% of circulating T lymphocytes)
- Dominant pathway in the immediate post-transplant period
- Rapid kinetics of T-cell activation

**Immunological basis:**
- Donor bone marrow-derived cells (dendritic cells, macrophages, B lymphocytes) migrate from the graft to secondary lymphoid organs
- Recipient T cells recognize donor MHC molecules as antigen-presenting structures
- Both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses are activated
- Results in vigorous alloreactive T-cell proliferation and effector function

#### Indirect Allorecognition

**Mechanism:**
Recipient professional APCs (primarily dendritic cells and B cells) process and present peptides derived from intact donor HLA antigens in the context of recipient HLA to recipient T cells. This pathway:
- Becomes increasingly important over time as donor-derived APCs disappear
- Mirrors the normal response to exogenous antigens
- Activates CD4+ helper T cells (predominantly Th1 and Th17)
- Is thought to be the primary pathway driving chronic rejection through B-cell licensing and donor-specific antibody (DSA) production

#### Semi-direct Allorecognition

**Mechanism:**
Recipient APCs acquire intact donor HLA molecules (through exosomes, membrane fragments, or transfer from other APCs) and present them at their own cell surface to recipient T cells. This hybrid pathway:
- May explain certain aspects of B-cell activation
- Can activate both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
- Contributes to sustained alloimmune response

### 2.2 Effector Mechanisms in Acute Cellular Rejection

#### CD8+ Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Function

**Activation and differentiation:**
- Alloreactive CD8+ T cells recognize donor MHC Class I-derived peptides
- CD4+ helper T cell signals provide costimulation and cytokines (IL-2, IL-12, IFN-γ)
- CD8+ CTLs differentiate into activated cytotoxic cells expressing:
  - Perforin and granzymes (cytotoxic effector molecules)
  - FasL (Fas ligand, mediates apoptosis)
  - TNF-α and IFN-γ

**Graft injury:**
- CTLs recognize and bind to graft endothelial cells and parenchymal cells expressing donor HLA Class I
- Release cytotoxic granules containing perforin and granzymes
- Perforin creates pores in target cell membranes; granzymes enter and activate caspase cascades → apoptosis
- FasL binding to Fas on graft cells → programmed cell death
- Direct cytotoxic damage to tubules, glomeruli, and vessels

#### CD4+ Helper T Cell Functions

**Th1 response (inflammatory):**
- Produces IL-2, TNF-α, and IFN-γ
- Activates macrophages through IFN-γ signaling
- Promotes CTL differentiation
- Drives acute cellular rejection

**Th17 response:**
- Produces IL-17, IL-22
- Recruits neutrophils and additional inflammatory cells
- Contributes to microvascular inflammation

**Other T-cell subsets:**
- Th9, Th2 cells: produce IL-4, IL-10 (more associated with chronic rejection)
- Regulatory T cells (Tregs, CD4+CD25+Foxp3+): suppress rejection but are dysfunctional in transplant recipients

#### Inflammatory Cell Infiltration

The inflammatory cascade recruits diverse cell types to the allograft:

| Cell Type | Role in ACR | Markers | Function |
|-----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| **Macrophages** | Activated by IFN-γ from CD4+ cells | CD68, M1 phenotype | Antigen presentation, cytokine production, tissue damage |
| **B lymphocytes** | Antigen presentation, cytokine production | CD20, HLA-DR | Support CD4+ T cells; produce pro-inflammatory cytokines |
| **Natural Killer (NK) cells** | Less clear in ACR vs. AMR | CD56 | Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity; direct killing |
| **Neutrophils** | Recruited by IL-17 | CD15, myeloperoxidase | Tissue damage through ROS, proteases |

### 2.3 Antibody-Mediated Rejection (AMR)

#### B-Cell Activation and Donor-Specific Antibody Formation

**Mechanism:**
1. **T-cell help to B cells:**
   - CD4+ helper T cells (Tfh cells) specific for donor HLA provide IL-21 and CD40-CD40L signals
   - Recipient B cells expressing B-cell receptors (BCR) specific for donor HLA are activated

2. **Germinal center formation:**
   - Activated B cells migrate to germinal centers in secondary lymphoid organs
   - Undergo clonal expansion and affinity maturation
   - Somatic hypermutation generates high-affinity variants

3. **Plasma cell differentiation:**
   - Some B cells differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells
   - These cells produce donor-specific antibodies (DSA) against HLA and non-HLA antigens

4. **Memory B-cell formation:**
   - Long-lived memory B cells persist in lymphoid organs and bone marrow
   - Rapidly re-activate upon antigen exposure (second exposure → stronger response)

#### Donor-Specific Antibody (DSA) Classes and Mechanisms

**Timing of DSA appearance:**
- **Pre-transplant DSA**: From prior sensitization (transfusion, pregnancy, prior transplant)
  - Increased risk of hyperacute or acute AMR
  - May be reduced/eliminated through desensitization
- **De novo DSA (dnDSA)**: Develops post-transplant from ongoing HLA exposure
  - 25-50% of recipients develop dnDSA by 5 years
  - Risk factors: HLA mismatch, non-adherence, cellular rejection episodes

**DSA immunoglobulin classes:**

| Ig Class | Characteristics | Persistence | Pathogenicity |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| **IgM** | Early response (transfusion, pregnancy) | Transient (weeks to months) | Complement-fixing; less stable |
| **IgG (overall)** | Main DSA class post-transplant | Months to years (long-lived) | More pathogenic than IgM |
| **IgG1** | Most abundant; highly complement-fixing | Long-lived | Strongly associated with AMR |
| **IgG3** | Moderately complement-fixing | Long-lived | Associated with AMR |
| **IgG2, IgG4** | Weak/no complement-fixing | Long-lived | Less pathogenic |
| **IgA** | Emerging importance | Variable | Associated with some AMR |

**Complement activation:**
- IgG1 and IgG3 activate classical complement pathway → C1q, C3, C5a generation
- C3a and C5a: powerful chemoattractants for inflammatory cells
- C5b-9 (membrane attack complex): creates pores in cell membranes → endothelial cell injury/activation

#### Antibody Binding Sites and Epitopes

**HLA Class I and II:**
- Mismatches at peptide-binding regions and non-binding regions both targeted
- Eplet analysis identifies highly immunogenic epitopes

**Non-HLA antigens:**
- MICA/MICB: stress-inducible, polymorphic; MICA-specific antibodies in 10-15% of sensitized patients
- Endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), vimentin, collagen, perlecan
- Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R): targeted by antibodies in some AMR cases
- Organ-specific antigens (e.g., MICA in kidney, K-alpha-1-tubulin in lung)

#### Mechanisms of Antibody-Mediated Graft Injury

**Complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC):**
- DSA binding to endothelial cells/parenchymal cells expressing donor antigen
- Complement activation (C3, C5a, MAC) → endothelial cell activation/lysis
- Endothelial injury → increased vascular permeability, thrombosis

**Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC):**
- IgG Fc region binding to Fc receptors (FcγRI, FcγRIII) on NK cells, macrophages, neutrophils
- Cross-linking of FcγR on effector cells → activation
- Release of cytotoxic mediators (granzymes, perforin) → target cell death

**Direct signaling:**
- Cross-linking of HLA molecules on endothelial cells → activation
- Integrin engagement → cell survival signals
- Endothelial cell activation → increased expression of adhesion molecules, coagulation factors

**Cellular infiltration:**
- Complement fragments (C3a, C5a) recruit inflammatory cells to graft
- DSA opsonization of graft cells → Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis
- Vascular injury → infiltration of T cells, macrophages, neutrophils

## 3. BANFF CLASSIFICATION AND HISTOPATHOLOGY

The **Banff classification** (updated 2017, 2019, 2021) provides standardized diagnostic criteria for acute and chronic rejection across organs. For kidney and heart, it distinguishes acute cellular rejection (ACR) and antibody-mediated rejection (AMR).

### 3.1 Acute Cellular Rejection (ACR) - Kidney Example

| Grade | Tubulitis | Intimal Arteritis | Arterial Necrosis | Diagnosis |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Borderline** | Mild mononuclear infiltration | Absent | Absent | Possible allograft rejection (careful follow-up warranted) |
| **I** | Significant (>25% tubules) | Absent | Absent | Probable allograft rejection |
| **II** | +/- | Present (moderate/marked) | Absent | Probable allograft rejection |
| **III** | +/- | +/- | Present (segmental or transmural) | Severe allograft rejection |

**Histologic features:**
- Mononuclear cell infiltrate (T lymphocytes, macrophages, B cells, dendritic cells)
- Infiltration into tubules (tubulitis) and vessel walls (intimal arteritis)
- Endothelial damage, vascular activation
- In severe cases (Grade III): vascular necrosis, thrombosis

### 3.2 Antibody-Mediated Rejection (AMR) - Banff 2019 Update

AMR is now classified into pathologic and clinical categories based on biopsy findings and clinical presentation.

**Active AMR (Banff 2019 pathologic criteria):**

Requires **morphologic evidence** of tissue injury plus **immunologic evidence** of antibody action:

1. **Morphologic features:**
   - Capillary injury: microvascular inflammation (glomerulitis, peritubular capillaritis)
   - Intimal/transmural arteritis
   - Linear or multi-layered IgG/IgM deposition in capillaries (C4d, C3d)

2. **Immunologic evidence:**
   - Donor-specific antibodies (DSA) detected in serum (HLA and/or non-HLA antibodies)
   - Glomerular/capillary deposition of immunoglobulin (Ig) and/or complement components (C4d, C3d, C5b-9)

3. **Classification levels:**
   - **Active AMR (vascular)**: Intimal/transmural arteritis with DSA and capillary C4d/C3d deposition
   - **Active AMR (humoral)**: Glomerular/peritubular capillary inflammation with DSA and C4d/C3d deposition but without arteritis

**Chronic Active AMR:**
- C4d deposition in capillaries
- Double contour/spike thickening (GBM changes)
- Transplant glomerulopathy
- Presence of DSA (or prior history of DSA)

---

## 4. CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND DIAGNOSIS

### 4.1 Clinical Features

**Acute rejection typically presents 1-3 months post-transplant with:**

**Kidney-specific signs:**
- Increase in serum creatinine (often >0.3 mg/dL above baseline)
- Reduced urine output
- Graft tenderness/swelling at transplant site
- Fever (variable)
- Proteinuria (new or increased)
- Hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis (from reduced GFR)

**Liver-specific signs:**
- Elevated transaminases (ALT, AST)
- Elevated bilirubin
- Coagulopathy (elevated PT/INR)
- Fever, malaise
- Jaundice (if severe)
- RUQ pain/tenderness

**Heart-specific signs:**
- Decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on echocardiography
- Signs of heart failure (orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, edema)
- Arrhythmias
- Decreased exercise tolerance
- Often clinically silent (detected on biopsy)

**Lung-specific signs:**
- Cough, dyspnea
- Fever
- Hypoxemia
- Infiltrates on chest x-ray
- Decline in pulmonary function (FEV1)

### 4.2 Diagnostic Approach

#### Laboratory Studies

**Kidney transplant:**
- Serum creatinine, BUN (elevated with rejection)
- Electrolytes: hyperkalemia, acidosis
- Urinalysis: may show pyuria (from T-cell infiltration), proteinuria
- Urine cytology: may show activated lymphocytes
- **Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA)**: Emerging biomarker; AlloSure assay measures percentage of cfDNA from donor. Elevation >1% highly sensitive for AMR; used for risk stratification
- **Gene expression profiling (GEP)**: TruGraf identifies subclinical rejection (>70% specificity/sensitivity)
- **DSA testing**: Single-antigen bead (SAB) Luminex assay identifies specific HLA/non-HLA antibodies; important for suspected AMR

**Liver transplant:**
- Liver function tests: alkaline phosphatase, GGT, bilirubin elevated
- PT/INR (synthetic function)
- Hepatitis B/C serologies (to exclude infection)
- CMV antigen (to exclude viral hepatitis)

**Heart transplant:**
- Troponin, BNP (markers of myocardial injury)
- Echocardiography: LVEF decline, segmental wall motion abnormalities
- ECG: may show ischemic changes

#### Imaging Studies

**Ultrasound (kidney):**
- Resistive index (RI) may be elevated in rejection (RI >0.8 suggestive)
- Peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity measured
- Gray-scale changes: graft swelling, loss of corticomedullary differentiation
- Less specific than biopsy but useful for trending

**Computed tomography (kidney, liver):**
- Graft enhancement pattern changes
- Perinephric fluid (kidney)
- Hepatic edema (liver)
- Non-specific; primarily rules out other causes

**Echocardiography (heart):**
- LVEF decline
- Regional wall motion abnormalities
- Diastolic dysfunction
- Key for serial monitoring

**Chest X-ray, CT chest (lung):**
- Infiltrates, consolidation
- Pleural effusion
- Nodules

#### Tissue Biopsy (Gold Standard)

**Kidney biopsy (percutaneous needle biopsy):**
- Indications:
  - Suspected acute rejection (rising creatinine without other explanation)
  - Persistent borderline or Grade I findings on screening biopsy
  - Suspected AMR (even with negative serum crossmatch)
  - Rising proteinuria post-transplant
  - Recurrent episodes
- Technique: Ultrasound-guided percutaneous 18-gauge needle core biopsy
- Complications: hematuria (common, usually self-limited), bleeding, infection, loss of graft (rare)
- Processing: Light microscopy, immunofluorescence (IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C4d, C1q), electron microscopy (EM) for some cases

**Liver biopsy:**
- Indications: elevated LFTs, suspected acute rejection, to grade severity
- Technique: Percutaneous, transjugular, or during surgery
- Grading: Banff classification (acute rejection activity index, ARAI score)

**Cardiac biopsy (endomyocardial biopsy, EMB):**
- Indications: Serial biopsies standard post-transplant; acute rejection suspected
- Technique: Bioptome passed through venous sheath into right ventricle; 2-3 pieces obtained
- Frequency: Often done weekly × 4, then at months 1, 3, 6, 12; then as indicated
- Complication: Perforation risk (rare); arrhythmia

**Lung biopsy:**
- Transbronchial biopsy: Multiple small samples; less invasive
- Transbronchial cryobiopsy: Larger samples, better diagnostic yield
- Open lung biopsy/VATS: When diagnosis unclear

## 5. TREATMENT OF ACUTE REJECTION

### 5.1 Acute Cellular Rejection (ACR)

#### First-Line Treatment: Corticosteroid Pulse Therapy

**Methylprednisolone pulse:**
- **Dose**: 500-1000 mg IV daily × 3-5 days
- **Mechanism**: Broad anti-inflammatory effect; inhibits T-cell activation, cytokine production
- **Success rate**: 70-90% of acute cellular rejection episodes respond to steroids alone
- **Response monitoring**: Serum creatinine, urine output, graft function markers

**Prednisolone taper:**
- After pulse: Transition to high-dose oral prednisolone (40-60 mg daily)
- Taper over 2-4 weeks to baseline maintenance dose
- Some centers use more aggressive tapers (completed in days) vs. gradual (weeks)

#### Second-Line: Lymphocyte-Depleting Antibodies

**Indications:**
- Steroid-resistant acute rejection (no improvement in graft function after 3-5 day pulse)
- Severe Grade III ACR with arterial necrosis
- Recurrent acute rejection episodes
- Combined with AMR features

**Anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG, Thymoglobulin):**
- **Dose**: 1.5 mg/kg IV daily × 7-14 days (standard 7-10 days)
- **Mechanism**: Polyclonal rabbit antiserum against human T-cell antigens (CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11a, CD18, CD25, HLA-DR); causes T-lymphocyte depletion through apoptosis and complement-dependent lysis
- **Efficacy**: Reverses 80-90% of steroid-resistant acute rejection
- **Adverse effects**:
  - Infusion reactions (fever, chills, rigors) → premedicate with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, methylprednisolone
  - Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia (reversible; monitor CBC)
  - Increased risk of infection (viral: CMV, EBV; bacterial; fungal)
  - Serum sickness-like reactions
  - Risk of PTLD (post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder)

**Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H):**
- **Dose**: 0.3-1 mg/kg IV (typical cumulative 30-60 mg)
- **Mechanism**: Humanized monoclonal antibody against CD52 (present on T cells, B cells, monocytes, macrophages)
- **Efficacy**: Comparable to ATG for rejection reversal
- **Advantage**: Better tolerated; humanized (less serum sickness)
- **Disadvantage**: May cause more profound, prolonged lymphopenia

#### Maintenance Immunosuppression Intensification

**Goals after acute rejection:**
- Prevent further episodes
- Optimize CNI levels
- Enhance other immunosuppressive components

**Adjustments:**
- **Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI)**: Reset to higher target troughs
  - Tacrolimus: target 12-15 ng/mL (vs. prior 8-12 ng/mL, for example)
  - Cyclosporine: target 200-250 ng/mL
  - Monitor drug levels closely; adjust based on kinetics
  
- **Antimetabolites**: Ensure adequate dosing
  - Mycophenolic acid: 1-1.5 g BID (mycophenolate mofetil or enteric-coated MPA)
  - Or azathioprine: 1-2 mg/kg daily if MPA contraindicated/intolerant
  
- **Corticosteroids**: Adjust taper to minimize dose reduction
  - Some centers maintain higher long-term maintenance dose (5-7.5 mg daily) vs. tapering to 2-5 mg
  
- **Consider switching agents**: E.g., from CNI to belatacept if CNI toxicity limits dosing, or addition of mTOR inhibitor if risk of viral reactivation (BK, CMV)

### 5.2 Antibody-Mediated Rejection (AMR)

#### Goals of Therapy

1. Reduce circulating donor-specific antibodies (DSA)
2. Reduce B-cell/plasma-cell populations
3. Inhibit complement activation
4. Optimize maintenance immunosuppression

#### First-Line Agents

**Therapeutic Plasma Exchange (TPE) or Immunoadsorption:**
- **TPE**: Removes circulating immunoglobulins (including DSA), immune complexes, complement fragments
  - Typical protocol: 5-10 exchanges over 5-10 days; each exchange removes ~60-80% of IgG
  - Monitor DSA levels (MFI) to assess response
  - Rebound DSA common without other interventions
  
- **Immunoadsorption**: More selective removal of DSA
  - Protein A immunoadsorption: Binds IgG Fc region
  - HLA-specific immunoadsorption: Binds HLA-specific antibodies (limited availability)
  - Advantages: More selective (preserves antibodies to infections, vaccines); fewer plasma volume replacement needs
  - Disadvantages: Expensive; limited availability

**Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG):**
- **Dose**: 2 g/kg IV, divided into 2-5 daily infusions (typical: 2-4 days)
- **Mechanism**: Multiple proposed effects:
  - Provides normal IgG to replace removed antibodies
  - Anti-idiotype effect: antibodies against donor-specific antibodies
  - Complement modulation
  - B-cell inhibition (through FcγRIIB signaling)
- **Efficacy**: Variable; often combined with other agents rather than monotherapy
- **Adverse effects**: Headache (most common), aseptic meningitis (rare), thrombosis (in high-risk), volume overload

**Rituximab (B-Cell Depletion):**
- **Dose**: 375-500 mg/m² IV × 1-2 doses (given weekly or separated by weeks)
- **Mechanism**: Chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibody against CD20 (B-cell surface antigen)
- **Effects**:
  - Depletes B-cell precursors and mature B cells
  - Reduces DSA production (plasma cells decline when B-cell supply exhausted)
  - Does NOT deplete long-lived bone marrow plasma cells (main DSA producers), hence DSA rebound common
- **Efficacy**: Reduces DSA levels when combined with IVIG/TPE; may prevent future dnDSA
- **Adverse effects**: Infusion reactions, infections (especially respiratory), immunosuppression

**Complement Inhibitors:**
- **Eculizumab (C5 inhibitor, Soliris)**:
  - Blocks complement activation at C5 level
  - Prevents C5a generation and MAC (C5b-9) formation
  - Less aggressive antibody reduction; may allow AMR management with persistent DSA if complement inhibited
  - Used as adjunct or in combination with TPE/IVIG/rituximab
  - Concern: Preserved complement-independent injury mechanisms
  
- **C1-esterase inhibitors**:
  - Berinert, Cinryze: Inhibit classical and lectin pathways
  - Preliminary data in small pilot studies; more trials ongoing

#### Second-Line/Emerging Agents

**Bortezomib (Proteasome Inhibitor):**
- **Mechanism**: Inhibits proteasome → apoptosis of plasma cells (which have high proteasomal demand)
- **Use**: In proteasome inhibitor-based desensitization protocols; some centers use for AMR treatment
- **Dose**: 1.3 mg/m² IV/SC on days 1, 4, 8, 11 of 21-day cycle
- **Efficacy**: Reports of dramatic DSA reduction, including in long-lived plasma cells
- **Adverse effects**: Peripheral neuropathy (dose-limiting), infections, cardiac complications

**Clazakizumab (IL-6 Ligand Antagonist):**
- **Mechanism**: Blocks IL-6 signaling; IL-6 important for Tfh cells (provide B-cell help) and B-cell maturation
- **Phase 2 trial**: Showed reduction in DSA, slower GFR decline in chronic AMR
- **Phase 3 trial ongoing**: In chronic active AMR
- **Advantage**: Selective B-cell targeting without pan-immunosuppression

**Tocilizumab (IL-6 Receptor Antagonist):**
- **Mechanism**: Similar to clazakizumab
- **Evidence**: Some centers report success in AMR and desensitization
- **Disadvantage**: Cost; infection risk

**Daratumumab (Anti-CD38):**
- **Mechanism**: Targets CD38 on B-cell lineage cells (including plasma cells)
- **Emerging use**: Case series and pilot studies in AMR desensitization
- **More data needed**: Before widespread adoption

**Imlifidase (IgG-Degrading Enzyme):**
- **Mechanism**: Cleaves human IgG at hinge region, inactivating antibodies (complement-fixing and ADCC-mediating effects lost)
- **Dramatic effect**: Can achieve negative crossmatch after single dose
- **Major limitation**: **DSA rebound** post-transplant (IgG regenerated within weeks); anti-imlifidase antibodies develop
- **Current role**: Limited; investigational for incompatible transplantation; not standard AMR therapy

#### Treatment Regimens for Active AMR

**Typical comprehensive protocol (varies by center):**
1. **Start immediately upon diagnosis**:
   - Methylprednisolone pulse: 500-1000 mg IV daily × 3 days
   - TPE or immunoadsorption: 5-10 exchanges over 7-10 days
   - IVIG: 2 g/kg IV (divided) on day 1 post-TPE

2. **Continue concurrent immunosuppression**:
   - Optimize CNI (higher troughs for rejection)
   - Ensure adequate MPA/azathioprine dosing
   - Continue baseline corticosteroids

3. **Add B-cell directed therapy** (if not already given):
   - Rituximab: 375-500 mg/m² IV (1-2 doses)
   - Repeat rituximab dosing based on B-cell recovery (CD19+ monitoring)

4. **Consider complement inhibition**:
   - Eculizumab induction and maintenance (weekly × 4, then every 2 weeks × 8, then monthly maintenance)

5. **Monitor and adapt**:
   - Repeat DSA testing at days 1, 3, 7, 14 post-initiation
   - Graft function (creatinine, proteinuria)
   - Imaging (ultrasound, biopsy if indicated at 1-2 weeks)
   - Biomarkers (dd-cfDNA, GEP) to assess response

**Duration:**
- Acute phase: 2-4 weeks (TPE, IVIG, rituximab)
- Complement inhibition: Continue ≥8-12 weeks based on response
- Long-term: Optimized maintenance immunosuppression indefinitely; continued monitoring for dnDSA

### 5.3 Treatment of Combined Cellular and Antibody-Mediated Rejection

When acute cellular rejection and AMR coexist:
- Combine corticosteroid pulse + lymphocyte-depleting antibody (rATG/alemtuzumab) for cellular component
- Add TPE/IVIG/rituximab ± eculizumab for AMR component
- Intensify maintenance immunosuppression

---

## 6. COMPLICATIONS OF ACUTE REJECTION TREATMENT

### 6.1 Infection

**Mechanisms:**
- Immunosuppression required for rejection reversal → increased infection risk
- Lymphopenia from antibody depletion delays immune recovery
- Disruption of mucosal barriers during TPE

**Timing and organisms:**
- **Early (weeks 1-4)**: Bacterial (UTI, pneumonia, surgical site infections)
- **Late (weeks 4-12)**: Viral (CMV, EBV, herpes simplex, BK polyomavirus)
- **Fungal**: Opportunistic (Candida, Aspergillus, PCP) with prolonged/severe immunosuppression

**Prophylaxis:**
- Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (PCP, UTI)
- Acyclovir/valganciclovir (HSV, CMV) × 3-6 months
- Consider antifungal if high-risk (Candida prophylaxis with fluconazole)

### 6.2 Bone Marrow Suppression

From rATG/alemtuzumab:
- **Neutropenia**: Monitor CBC; hold if ANC <1000/μL
- **Thrombocytopenia**: Risk of bleeding; platelet transfusions if <10,000/μL
- **Anemia**: From reduced RBC production; iron supplementation, EPO if needed

### 6.3 Secondary Malignancy Risk

**PTLD (Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder):**
- Increased risk with prolonged intense immunosuppression (rATG, alemtuzumab)
- EBV-driven proliferation of B cells (especially in EBV-seronegative recipients)
- Present as fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, organ dysfunction
- Managed by reducing immunosuppression, rituximab, chemotherapy if necessary

---

## 7. OUTCOMES AND PROGNOSIS

### 7.1 Response to Treatment

**Acute cellular rejection:**
- Steroid-responsive: 70-90% of ACR episodes reverse with corticosteroid pulse
- Steroid-resistant: 10-30% require additional therapy (rATG, alemtuzumab)
- Overall reversal: >90% of acute rejection episodes can be partially or fully reversed

**Antibody-mediated rejection:**
- Response variable; depends on DSA levels, antibody specificity, degree of complement activation
- Active AMR with aggressive therapy: 40-60% achieve good graft function response
- Some recipients develop chronic AMR despite treatment

### 7.2 Long-Term Impact

**Acute rejection as risk factor for chronic rejection:**
- Patients with one acute rejection episode at 2-3× risk of chronic rejection
- Multiple episodes: exponential increase in chronic rejection risk
- Early aggressive treatment reduces (but does not eliminate) risk of progression

**Graft survival:**
- Recipients with acute rejection: median graft survival 11-15 years
- No acute rejection: median graft survival 15-20+ years
- Individual factors (age, race, immunologic risk) modify these estimates

---

## 8. SUMMARY AND KEY CONCEPTS

1. **Acute rejection is immune-mediated graft injury** orchestrated by both T cells (direct allorecognition dominant early) and B cells/antibodies (indirect pathway important for chronic progression).

2. **Early diagnosis is critical**: Clinical suspicion + tissue biopsy (gold standard) + laboratory studies (DSA, biomarkers, dd-cfDNA) enable prompt intervention.

3. **Acute cellular rejection** responds well to corticosteroid pulse therapy (70-90%); steroid-resistant cases require lymphocyte-depleting antibodies (rATG, alemtuzumab).

4. **Antibody-mediated rejection** requires multi-modal therapy: plasma exchange/immunoadsorption + IVIG + rituximab ± complement inhibition. Long-term outcomes variable.

5. **Acute rejection → chronic rejection**: Single episode increases risk 2-3×; prevention and aggressive early treatment critical for long-term graft survival.

6. **Maintenance immunosuppression optimization** after rejection episode (higher CNI troughs, ensured adequate antimetabolites) essential to prevent recurrence.
