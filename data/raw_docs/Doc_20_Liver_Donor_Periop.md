# DOCUMENT 20: LIVER TRANSPLANT - DONOR EVALUATION AND PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

## Executive Summary

Donor liver quality directly impacts recipient outcomes. Extended criteria donors (older, higher transaminases, fatty infiltration) and donation after cardiac death (DCD) provide alternatives to standard criteria donors but carry increased risk of early allograft dysfunction and ischemic cholangiopathy. Perioperative management focuses on optimization of donor and recipient hemodynamics, expert surgical technique, and prevention of early complications including primary graft dysfunction and ischemic cholangiopathy. This document comprehensively addresses donor evaluation, organ-specific considerations, and perioperative management principles for liver transplantation.

## 1. LIVER DONOR EVALUATION AND CLASSIFICATION

### 1.1 Donor Quality Assessment

**Standard criteria donor (SCD):**
- Age <60 years
- No steatosis on histology, or <20% macrovascular steatosis
- AST/ALT <2× upper limit of normal
- Negative culture
- Stable hemodynamics (MAP >70 mmHg)
- No significant liver disease

**Extended criteria donor (ECD) characteristics:**
- **Age >60 years** (particularly >70)
- **Elevated transaminases** (AST/ALT >2× ULN)
- **Fatty infiltration** (>20% macrovascular steatosis on biopsy)
- **Steatohepatitis (NASH):** Fatty infiltration + inflammation/fibrosis
- **Cold ischemia time >12 hours**
- **DCD donation** (donation after cardiac death)
- **Hepatitis C seropositive** (historically; now often transplanted with DAA therapy)
- **Mild-moderate renal dysfunction** (GFR 50-80)

**Donor risk index (DRI):**
- Quantifies donor quality; used to match with recipient risk
- Higher DRI = higher risk graft
- Recipients with good expected function (lower MELD) → may match with higher DRI organs
- Recipients sicker → prefer lower DRI organs (less risk)

### 1.2 Hepatic Steatosis Assessment

**Clinical significance:**
- **Macrovascular steatosis** (>30%) → significantly increases primary graft dysfunction, early dysfunction risk
- **Microvascular steatosis** → less prognostic value; may be reversible with reperfusion

**Assessment methods:**
- **Visual inspection (intraoperative):** Experienced surgeon can estimate
- **Liver biopsy (percutaneous):** Gold standard for histology
  - Indications: ECD donor, elevated transaminases, imaging suggests steatosis
  - Grading: % macrovascular steatosis (goal <20-30%)
  - If >30-40%: High risk; decline or use cautiously

- **Imaging (ultrasound, CT):** Qualitative assessment
  - Hyperechoicity (ultrasound) suggests steatosis
  - Less specific than biopsy; not reliable for degree

**Management if steatosis present:**
- Avoid further risk (e.g., if also older, consider declining)
- Match with lower-MELD recipient (more functional reserve)
- Minimize cold ischemia time
- Consider machine perfusion (may improve recovery)

### 1.3 Viral and Serologic Status

**Hepatitis C (HCV):**
- Historically contraindication
- Now: Many centers transplant HCV+ donors to HCV+ recipients
- Rationale: Antiviral therapy (DAAs) can cure HCV post-transplant; outcomes excellent
- Also: HCV+ organs to HCV− recipients if carefully managed (rare)

**Hepatitis B (HBV):**
- HBsAg+ donor: Relative contraindication traditionally
- Now: Transplant to HBsAg− recipient with HBIG + antivirals
- HBIG (hepatitis B immunoglobulin) passive prophylaxis
- Antivirals (entecavir, tenofovir) prevent reinfection
- Outcomes improved with modern prophylaxis

**HIV:**
- Historically absolute contraindication
- Emerging: HIV+ organs to HIV+ recipients with controlled CD4 >200
- Limited experience; specialized centers only

**CMV/EBV status:**
- Documented; guides prophylaxis
- D+R− higher risk for CMV disease (standard prophylaxis applies)

## 2. PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

### 2.1 Donor Optimization

**Hemodynamic support:**
- **Goal:** MAP >70 mmHg, adequate urine output >1 mL/kg/hour
- **Fluids:** Balanced crystalloid; avoid excessive volume (hepatic edema)
- **Vasopressors:** Dopamine (low-dose renal effect) or norepinephrine if needed

**Organ-specific considerations:**
- **Maintain warm perfusion:** Cold damages hepatocytes
- **Avoid excessive ventilation:** Avoid barotrauma; gentle ventilation
- **Prevent ischemia:** Donor liver very sensitive to warm ischemia; minimize time before procurement

**Laboratory monitoring:**
- **INR, CBC:** Check; correct coagulopathy if present
- **Electrolytes:** Correct abnormalities
- **Glucose:** Maintain normoglycemia
- **Blood cultures:** If febrile; document

### 2.2 Operative Technique

**Donor hepatectomy:**
- Standard ex situ technique: Liver removed, flushed with cold solution on back table
- **In situ flush:** Aortic cannulation; cold solution infused through hepatic artery; vena cava vented
- Careful dissection: Preserve all structures (hepatic artery, portal vein, bile duct, suprahepatic/infrahepatic IVC)
- Portal vein/hepatic artery backflushing to clear blood, reduce IRI

**Allograft preservation:**
- **Cold preservation solution:** UW or HTK
- **Flush volume:** 500-1000 mL
- **Temperature:** 0-4°C (hypothermia reduces metabolism)
- **Transport:** Sterile container, ice, rapid transport

**Cold ischemia time:**
- **Acceptable:** Up to 12-15 hours (preferably <8 hours)
- **Effect:** Each hour increases primary graft dysfunction risk ~1-2%
- **>20 hours:** Significantly increased dysfunction, ischemic cholangiopathy risk

**Machine perfusion (emerging):**
- **HOPE (hypothermic oxygenated perfusion):** Reduces ischemic cholangiopathy in ECD livers
- **Normothermic perfusion:** Experimental; enables assessment, potential "reconditioning"
- **Benefits:** Improved function; extended preservation window

### 2.3 Recipient Preparation

**Recipient preoperative assessment:**
- **Cross-match:** Blood type, infectious serology
- **Coagulation studies:** May have coagulopathy from liver disease; correct if severe
- **Hemodynamic assessment:** Portal hypertension may cause relative hypotension
- **Anesthesia clearance:** Review cardiac/pulmonary status

**Recipient positioning and access:**
- **Supine:** Standard position
- **Incision:** Bilateral subcostal (chevron) or midline
- **Vascular access:** Large-bore IVs, central line, PA catheter often placed
- **Monitoring:** Continuous cardiac monitoring, invasive BP monitoring

### 2.4 Recipient Hepatectomy and Allograft Implantation

**Native hepatectomy:**
- **Dissection:** Around hepatic hilum, careful hemostasis
- **Vascular control:** Infrahepatic IVC clamped; suprahepatic IVC clamped
- **Hepatic artery:** Divided and ligated
- **Portal vein:** Divided and ligated
- **Bile duct:** Divided and ligated
- **Liver removed:** Careful to avoid spillage

**Anhepatic phase:**
- **Duration:** 30-120 minutes typically (vascular clamps in place)
- **Hemodynamic management:** Relative hypotension expected (decreased venous return); support with fluids, vasopressors
- **Coagulopathy:** Severe in this phase; massive transfusion risk

**Allograft implantation:**

**Suprahepatic IVC anastomosis (piggyback technique increasingly common):**
- Graft suprahepatic vein anastomosed to recipient IVC (end-to-side)
- Preserves recipient IVC flow (lower hemodynamic impact)
- **Clamping:** Suprahepatic IVC clamped above anastomosis; no aortic cross-clamp needed

**Infrahepatic IVC anastomosis (traditional):**
- Graft infrahepatic vein anastomosed to recipient infrahepatic IVC (end-to-end)
- Requires aortic cross-clamping (if vena cava below renal veins also clamped)
- More hemodynamic impairment

**Portal vein anastomosis:**
- Graft portal vein anastomosed to recipient portal vein (end-to-end, or end-to-side)
- Typical: End-to-end to avoid stenosis

**Hepatic artery anastomosis:**
- Graft hepatic artery to recipient hepatic artery (end-to-end)
- Alternative: Aortic interposition (if severe recipient atherosclerosis)

**Bile duct anastomosis:**
- **Duct-to-duct (most common):** Graft common bile duct anastomosed to recipient common bile duct
  - Requires patent recipient bile duct
  - Advantage: Preserves sphincter of Oddi function; allows endoscopic management if stricture
  
- **Choledochocholedochostomy** (duct-to-duct variant)
  
- **Choledochojejunostomy:** If recipient bile duct unavailable (post-cholecystectomy with failed ERCP, PSC with complex strictures)
  - Roux-en-Y jejunal loop anastomosed to graft bile duct
  - Advantage: Single anastomosis, no sphincter obstruction
  - Disadvantage: Ascending cholangitis risk higher; harder to access endoscopically

### 2.5 Reperfusion and Post-Implantation

**Reperfusion sequence:**
1. **IVC unclamped:** Flow restored
2. **Portal vein unclamped:** Warm perfusion begins
3. **Monitor:** Sudden hypotension possible (endotoxin release); manage with fluids, vasopressors
4. **Hepatic artery unclamped:** Completion of reperfusion
5. **Bile production:** Color changes from dark to pink/bile-colored (good sign)
6. **Hemostasis:** Check for bleeding; pack spaces if ongoing

**Ischemic preconditioning:**
- Brief periods of clamping/unclamping before reperfusion
- May reduce reperfusion injury in select cases
- Mechanism: Triggers cellular protective pathways

## 3. EARLY POST-OPERATIVE PERIOD

### 3.1 Early Graft Function

**Immediate function (most common; ~70%):**
- Rapid INR correction (by 2-4 hours)
- Early bile production
- Creatinine begins declining (as renal perfusion improves)
- Excellent outcomes expected

**Slow graft function (~20-25%):**
- Gradual INR improvement (takes days)
- Delayed bile production
- High bilirubin, transaminases
- Coagulopathy persists 2-7 days
- Manage with close monitoring, ICU support
- Most eventually recover full function

**Primary graft dysfunction (PGD; ~5-15%):**
- Severe dysfunction: Coagulopathy persists, jaundice profound, graft failure imminent
- Severe PGD mortality: 40-60% require retransplantation
- Definition varies (fulminant, severe; based on INR, bilirubin, transaminases at 3-7 days)

**Primary graft non-function (very rare; <1%):**
- Complete loss of function
- Retransplantation required emergently

---

### 3.2 Early Complications

**Vascular:**
- **Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT):** 1-2% incidence; ischemic necrosis of bile duct (stricture, leak)
  - Diagnosis: Doppler ultrasound (no flow)
  - Management: Urgent thrombectomy (if within hours) vs. retransplantation
  
- **Portal vein thrombosis:** <1%; severe; retransplantation usually needed

**Biliary:**
- **Bile leak:** 1-2%; from anastomosis, ducts within remnant liver
  - Diagnosis: Elevated amylase in drain, peritonitis
  - Management: ERCP with sphincterotomy ± stent; percutaneous drain if loculated
  
- **Bile duct stricture:** Early (anastomotic) or late (ischemic); discussed in Document 25

**Hemorrhage:**
- **Bleeding:** 5-10% require re-exploration
- **Sources:** Anastomotic, liver bed, coagulopathy
- **Management:** Correct coagulopathy, re-explore if bleeding continues
