# DOCUMENT 19: LIVER TRANSPLANT - INDICATIONS AND CANDIDATE SELECTION

## Executive Summary

Liver transplantation is the definitive therapy for end-stage liver disease (ESLD), acute liver failure (ALF), and select hepatic malignancies. Patient selection is critical—candidates must have sufficient likelihood of 5-year survival post-transplant and benefit from transplantation compared to medical management alone. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score has revolutionized allocation by prioritizing sickest patients. This document comprehensively addresses indications for liver transplantation, absolute and relative contraindications, candidate evaluation, and contemporary allocation strategies.

## 1. INDICATIONS FOR LIVER TRANSPLANTATION

### 1.1 Chronic Liver Disease (CLD) Indications

**Primary indications (most common):**

| Indication | % of Transplants | MELD Threshold | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Hepatitis C (HCV)** | 25-30% | Varies; MELD ≥15 typical | DAAs cure; transplant decisions changing |
| **Alcoholic liver disease (ALD)** | 20-25% | MELD ≥15-18 | 6-month sobriety typically required |
| **Hepatitis B (HBV)** | 5-10% | MELD ≥15 | HBIG + antivirals prevent reinfection |
| **Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)** | 15-20% | MELD ≥15-18 | Growing indication |
| **Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)** | 5% | Ursodeoxycholic acid failure | Rare; well-tolerated |
| **Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)** | 5% | Recurrent cholangitis, cancer risk | Inflammatory bowel disease association |
| **Cryptogenic cirrhosis** | 5-10% | MELD ≥15-18 | Unknown etiology |
| **Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)** | 2-3% | Corticosteroid-refractory | Good outcomes |
| **Hemochromatosis** | 2-3% | MELD ≥15 | Excellent prognosis post-transplant |
| **Wilson disease** | <1% | Early/fulminant | Excellent outcomes with transplant |
| **Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency** | 1-2% | MELD ≥15 | Prevents lung disease progression |
| **Other (PVT, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding)** | 5-10% | Variable | Individualized |

**MELD score:**
- **Formula:** MELD = 3.78 × ln(bilirubin [mg/dL]) + 11.2 × ln(INR) + 9.57 × ln(creatinine [mg/dL]) + 6.43
- **Range:** 6-40+ (higher = sicker)
- **Clinical significance:**
  - MELD <10: Low priority (low mortality risk on waiting list)
  - MELD 10-20: Moderate priority
  - MELD >20: High priority
  - MELD >30: Very high priority (high mortality on waiting list without transplant)

**MELD modifications (exception points):**
- **Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC):** If Milan criteria met, receive MELD exception points (priority boost)
- **Hepatic encephalopathy:** If refractory, may receive exception points
- **Portal vein thrombosis (PVT):** If significant, exception points available
- **Polycystic liver disease:** Exception points for massive hepatomegaly
- Other conditions individualized

---

### 1.2 Acute Liver Failure (ALF)

**Definition:** Coagulopathy (INR ≥1.5) + encephalopathy in patient without prior liver disease, occurring within weeks

**Indications for transplant (high mortality without transplant):**
- **King's College Hospital (KCH) criteria:**
  - **Acetaminophen-induced:** pH <7.3 OR (INR >6.5 AND creatinine >3.4 mg/dL AND encephalopathy grade III-IV)
  - **Non-acetaminophen:** INR >6.5 OR any 3 of: age <11 or >40 years, INR >3.5, bilirubin >17.5 mg/dL, time to jaundice > 7 days

- **Transplant urgency:** Status 1A (highest priority; can be within days if meets criteria)

---

### 1.3 Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)

**Indications:**
- **Within Milan criteria:**
  - Single tumor ≤5 cm, OR
  - Up to 3 tumors each ≤3 cm
  - No vascular invasion, no extrahepatic metastases
  
- **Extended criteria (some centers):**
  - Larger tumors if otherwise good transplant candidate
  - San Francisco criteria: Single ≤6.5 cm or up to 3 tumors ≤4.5 cm

**Rationale:**
- 5-year survival 70-80% within Milan criteria
- Transplant only curative therapy (vs. resection, ablation for early HCC)
- Prevents HCC recurrence (common with resection alone)

---

### 1.4 Select Living Donor Indications

**Advantages over deceased donor:**
- Planned surgery (no urgent decompensation)
- Better donor-recipient matching (genetic relation possible)
- Shorter ischemia time
- Superior graft survival

**Typical indications:** Chronic ESLD with MELD 10-25 (not fulminant)

## 2. CONTRAINDICATIONS TO LIVER TRANSPLANTATION

### 2.1 Absolute Contraindications

| Contraindication | Rationale | Notes |
|-----------------|----------|-------|
| **Uncontrolled active infection** | Infection worsens with IS; sepsis incompatible | Must treat first; defer transplant |
| **Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma** | Metastatic disease; poor transplant outcomes | >Milan or extended criteria |
| **Active substance abuse (drugs/alcohol)** | Non-adherence risk; recidivism | Alcohol: 6-month sobriety required minimum |
| **Severe cardiopulmonary disease (unrepaired)** | Surgical risk prohibitive; cannot tolerate IS | CAD, COPD, PAH must be optimized first |
| **Significant extrahepatic malignancy** | Metastatic disease; limited life expectancy | Depends on cancer type/prognosis |
| **Irreversible brain damage** | Cannot consent; poor quality of life | Rare; ethical consideration |
| **Thrombosis of portal vein AND splenic vein** | Surgical reconstruction very difficult | Some centers can manage with options |
| **HIV-positive (in non-HIV+ donor context)** | High mortality; poor outcomes historically | Now acceptable with controlled HIV + HCV+ donor |

---

### 2.2 Relative Contraindications (Individualize)

| Contraindication | Assessment | Management |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Age >65 years** | Physiologic age; comorbidities | Often acceptable; outcomes reasonable |
| **Severe obesity (BMI >35-40)** | Surgical complications | Weight loss program; consider carefully |
| **Portal vein thrombosis (PVT)** | Technically reconstructible? | If limited thrombosis, transplant possible |
| **Hepatitis B (HBsAg+)** | Reinfection risk; antiviral available | HBIG + antivirals prevent reinfection |
| **Prior abdominal surgery** | Technical difficulty | Increased operative time; not contraindication |
| **Renal dysfunction (eGFR <30)** | Calcineurin inhibitor toxicity | Consider kidney-liver transplant if ESRD |
| **Pulmonary hypertension (moderate)** | Right heart failure post-transplant | If mPAP <35 mmHg, usually tolerated |
| **Severe coronary artery disease (CAD)** | Perioperative MI risk | Optimize medically; revascularize if needed |
| **Diabetes mellitus** | Hyperglycemia; infection risk | Manage perioperatively; not contraindication |
| **Psychiatric illness** | Adherence, medication management | If stable/treated, not contraindication |
| **Low social support** | Adherence risk | Assess carefully; offer support services |

## 3. CANDIDATE EVALUATION

### 3.1 Medical Assessment

**Organ-specific evaluation:**

**Cardiovascular:**
- **History:** Prior MI, CAD, arrhythmia
- **Physical:** Signs of heart failure, volume overload
- **Testing:**
  - ECG: Baseline
  - Echocardiography: LVEF, diastolic function, PAP
  - Stress test or coronary angiography if high-risk
  - Goal: LVEF >35-40%; tolerate moderate PAP if mPAP <35 mmHg

**Hepatic/portal:**
- **Imaging:** Ultrasound/CT abdomen assess liver size, cirrhosis, PVT, HCC
  - Portal vein patency/thrombosis
  - Splenic vein patency (if PVT, assess splenectomy need)
  - Ascites presence/severity
  - Varices assessment

**Renal:**
- **Serum creatinine, eGFR:** MELD includes creatinine
- **Proteinuria:** Assess for renal disease
- **If eGFR <30:** Consider kidney-liver transplant vs. liver alone

**Pulmonary:**
- **History:** Shortness of breath, smoking
- **Physical:** Lung sounds, SpO2
- **Testing:**
  - Chest X-ray: Baseline
  - PFTs: If COPD suspected (mPAP >35 mmHg relative contraindication)
  - Chest imaging if nodules concern

**Metabolic:**
- **Glucose:** Assess for diabetes
- **Lipids:** Dyslipidemia common
- **Nutrition:** Assess for sarcopenia (poor prognosis marker)

**Infectious:**
- **Serology:** CMV, EBV, HSV, VZV, HIV, HBV, HCV
- **Screening:** TB (IGRA/TST), syphilis, others
- **Baseline status documented for post-transplant prophylaxis

**Malignancy:**
- **Age-appropriate screening:** Colon, breast, prostate, cervix (if not contraindicated)
- **HCC screening:** Ultrasound ± AFP (if cirrhosis)
- **History:** Prior malignancy → assess cancer-free interval

### 3.2 Psychosocial Evaluation

**Components:**

| Area | Assessment |
|------|-----------|
| **Psychiatric history** | Prior/current mental illness; treatment status |
| **Substance use** | Alcohol/drugs; recovery if history |
| **Adherence** | Prior medication compliance |
| **Support system** | Family, social support present? |
| **Motivation** | Understands transplant process; realistic expectations |
| **Coping skills** | Ability to handle stress, manage complications |
| **Financial** | Insurance, ability to afford IS/medications |
| **Health literacy** | Understands need for post-transplant follow-up |

**Red flags:**
- Active substance abuse (alcohol or drugs)
- Untreated psychiatric illness
- Severe social isolation
- Unrealistic expectations ("transplant = cure")
- Financial barriers to adherence

**6-month sobriety rule (alcohol-induced cirrhosis):**
- **Rationale:** Assess commitment to abstinence; allow liver recovery; reduce recurrent alcohol use risk
- **Exception:** Fulminant hepatic failure from alcohol (more forgiving; some transplant without waiting)
- **Monitoring:** Regular drug screening, support programs (AA, rehabilitation)

## 4. ALLOCATION STRATEGY

### 4.1 MELD-Based Allocation

**Current system (implemented 2002-2018 evolution):**
- **Priority:** Patients with highest MELD score receive priority
- **Rationale:** Reduce mortality on waiting list (sickest-first)
- **Effect:** Fewer patients die awaiting transplant; earlier transplant for decompensated patients

**HCC exception points:**
- Patients with HCC within Milan criteria receive exception points (boost MELD)
- Goal: Transplant before HCC progresses beyond Milan criteria
- Controversy: Some debate fairness (HCC patients prioritized over sicker non-HCC patients)

**Share model:**
- **Local:** Organs offered locally first
- **Regional:** If no local match, offered regionally
- **National:** If no regional match, offered nationally
- **Goal:** Balance geographic equity with ischemia time (shorter is better)

---

### 4.2 Living Donor Allocation

**Planned surgeries:**
- Donor and recipient matched by surgeon/center
- No waiting list (elective timing)
- Superior outcomes vs. deceased donor

---

## 5. SUMMARY AND KEY CONCEPTS

1. **Primary indications:** HCV (25-30%), ALD (20-25%), NAFLD (15-20%), others
2. **MELD score:** Prioritizes sickest patients; >20 = high priority
3. **Absolute contraindications:** Active infection, uncontrolled substance abuse, metastatic cancer
4. **Relative contraindications:** Age >65, obesity, PVT, CAD (individualize; often acceptable)
5. **6-month sobriety:** Required for ALD (assess commitment to abstinence)
6. **HCC:** Within Milan criteria = good transplant candidate; extended criteria individualized
7. **Comprehensive evaluation:** Cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, pulmonary, infectious, malignancy, psychosocial
8. **MELD exceptions:** HCC, hepatic encephalopathy, PVT modify allocation priority
