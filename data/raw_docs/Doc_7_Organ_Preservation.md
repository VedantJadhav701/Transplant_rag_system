# DOCUMENT 7: ORGAN PRESERVATION - COLD STORAGE AND MACHINE PERFUSION

## Executive Summary

Organ preservation is the period between donor organ procurement and transplantation into the recipient. The primary challenge is minimizing ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)—cellular damage occurring when blood flow is interrupted (ischemia) and then restored (reperfusion). Traditional static cold storage (SCS) has been the standard for decades, but emerging machine perfusion (MP) technologies enable dynamic organ monitoring, functional assessment, and potential therapeutic intervention. This document comprehensively addresses preservation strategies, mechanisms of ischemic injury, and evidence for novel preservation technologies across solid organ transplantation.

## 1. ISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION INJURY (IRI)

### 1.1 Mechanisms of Ischemic Injury

#### Energy Depletion

**Normal aerobic metabolism:**
- Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation generates ATP
- Maintains ion gradients (Na+/K+ ATPase), cellular function
- Continuous: ~1-2 ATP molecules regenerated per glucose

**During ischemia (anaerobic conditions):**
- Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation ceases (no O2)
- ATP production drops to ~2% of basal level (from anaerobic glycolysis alone)
- ATP depletion within minutes (brain cells: 3-5 min; kidney/liver cells: 15-30 min)
- Na+/K+ ATPase fails → cellular swelling (cytotoxic edema)
- Calcium homeostasis lost → intracellular Ca2+ accumulation

**Consequences:**
- Endothelial cell dysfunction (loss of NO production, increased permeability)
- Epithelial cell injury (tubular epithelium in kidney; hepatocytes in liver)
- Smooth muscle cell dysfunction
- Myocardial stunning (cardiac cells)
- Increased expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin)

#### Intracellular Calcium Overload

**Mechanism:**
- ATP depletion → Na+/K+ ATPase failure → intracellular Na+ accumulation
- Na+ accumulation activates Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (reversed direction) → intracellular Ca2+ accumulation
- Also: Direct activation of Ca2+ channels during ischemia

**Consequences of Ca2+ overload:**
- Activation of calpains and caspases (proteolytic enzymes) → protein degradation
- Activation of phospholipase A2 → membrane lipid degradation → loss of membrane integrity
- Mitochondrial damage (Ca2+ uptake → mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS production)
- Activation of apoptotic pathways

#### Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Generation

**During ischemia:**
- Mitochondrial function impaired → incomplete electron transport → ROS generation (superoxide, hydroxyl radical)
- Xanthine oxidase activation (from ATP catabolism to adenosine → inosine → hypoxanthine → xanthine; xanthine oxidase generates ROS)

**During early reperfusion (most critical):**
- Reintroduction of oxygen
- Incomplete electron transport chains (still recovering) generate massive ROS
- Iron-catalyzed reactions (Fenton reaction) → hydroxyl radical generation
- Neutrophil infiltration → NADPH oxidase-derived ROS
- Peak ROS generation: First 15-30 minutes of reperfusion

**Consequences of ROS:**
- Lipid peroxidation → membrane damage
- Protein oxidation → loss of enzyme function
- DNA damage → apoptosis
- Mitochondrial dysfunction

### 1.2 Reperfusion Injury and Inflammation

**Immediate reperfusion response (minutes):**
- Reactive oxygen species burst (see above)
- Endothelial cell activation (upregulation of adhesion molecules, TF)
- Thrombosis (tissue factor expression, platelet aggregation)
- Complement activation (C3a, C5a generation; classical pathway from IgM on damaged endothelium)

**Early inflammatory phase (hours):**
- Neutrophil infiltration (recruited by C5a, chemokines)
- Macrophage infiltration
- Production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8)
- Increased vascular permeability → edema
- Increased endothelial dysfunction

**Consequences:**
- Graft edema (especially problematic in lung, brain)
- Microvascular thrombosis
- Delayed graft function (DGF) in kidney
- Primary graft dysfunction in liver
- Primary graft failure (PGF) in heart
- Early bronchial artery injury in lung → airway complications

## 2. STATIC COLD STORAGE (SCS)

### 2.1 Principles and Mechanism

**Definition:** Organ placed in cold preservation solution at 0-4°C without active perfusion

**Mechanism of protective effect:**
- **Reduced metabolism:** Cold decreases metabolic rate ~7-10× per °C drop (Q10 effect)
  - At 4°C: Metabolic rate ~2-3% of 37°C
  - Result: ATP depletion rate slowed
  - Allows organ to tolerate ischemia hours (vs. minutes at 37°C)

- **Reduced enzyme activity:** Cold slows enzymatic reactions including proteolysis, lipid peroxidation

- **Reduced inflammation:** Cold suppresses inflammatory cascade (neutrophil infiltration, cytokine production)

**Overall goal:** "Hibernation" of organ metabolism; extends ischemic tolerance

### 2.2 Cold Preservation Solutions

**Historical solutions:**
- **Normal saline:** Minimal organ preservation; acceptable only <2-3 hours

**Modern solutions (intracellular-type formulations):**
- **University of Wisconsin (UW) solution:** Gold standard for many organs
  - Components: Impermeants (lactobionic acid, raffinose), colloids (hydroxyethyl starch), antioxidants (allopurinol, glutathione)
  - pH ~7.4, osmolality 320 mOsm/kg
  - Composition mimics intracellular fluid (high K+, low Na+)
  - Mechanism: Prevents cell swelling (impermeants retain water outside cell); reduces ROS (antioxidants)
  - Use: Kidney, liver, pancreas, intestine (not ideal for heart, lung)

- **HTK (Histidine-Tryptophan-Ketoglutarate) solution (Custodiol):**
  - Components: Histidine (buffer), tryptophan (membrane stabilization), ketoglutarate (metabolism)
  - Formulation: Extracellular-type (low K+)
  - Use: Especially heart, lung (good for hypoxic organs)
  - Mechanism: Membrane stabilization; reduced reperfusion injury
  - Comparable outcomes to UW for kidney/liver in some studies

- **Newer solutions:** Organ-specific optimizations
  - Subnormothermic perfusate: Warmed solutions preserving organs at 20-30°C (better than 4°C for some organs)
  - Oxygen-supplemented solutions: Reduce hypoxic injury during preservation

**Solution composition principles:**
- **Impermeants:** Lactobionic acid, raffinose, mannitol → prevent water entry into cells during cold → reduce edema
- **Colloids:** Hydroxyethyl starch, albumin → maintain oncotic pressure
- **Antioxidants:** Allopurinol, glutathione, ascorbate, deferoxamine → scavenge ROS
- **Buffers:** Bicarbonate, HEPES, phosphate → maintain pH
- **Electrolytes:** Variable K+/Na+ ratio depending on formulation
- **Glucose/substrates:** Fuel for residual metabolism

### 2.3 SCS Protocol

**Donor organ procurement:**
1. **In situ flush:** Aortic cannulation; cold preservation solution infused through aorta
   - Flush rapidly cools organ
   - Removes blood, RBCs (reduce IRI)
   - Vena cava/portal vein vented to decompress organ
   - Typical volume: 50-100 mL/kg over 5-10 minutes

2. **Explantation and back-table:** Careful dissection; further flushing on sterile field

3. **Transport:** Organ placed in sterile bag → cold saline → outer insulated cooler with ice

**Acceptable cold ischemia times:**
- **Kidney:** 24-36 hours (preferred <12 hours)
- **Liver:** 12-15 hours (preferred <8 hours)
- **Heart:** <4 hours (rarely tolerated >6 hours; 4 hours is practical limit)
- **Lung:** <6-8 hours
- **Pancreas:** <12-15 hours

**Temperature maintenance:**
- Goal: Keep organ ≤8°C (ideally 1-4°C)
- Monitor: Temperature tags in cooler
- Transport time minimized (race against clock)

### 2.4 Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**
- Simple, inexpensive
- Established, proven track record (decades of use)
- Portable, suitable for long-distance transport
- No equipment required
- No expertise needed (solution preparation, flushing)

**Disadvantages:**
- **No functional assessment:** Cannot evaluate organ viability during preservation
- **Ongoing IRI:** Cold slows but does not stop ischemic injury
- **Time constraint:** Limited acceptable ischemia time (heart: <4 hours)
- **IRI-related complications:** Increased delayed graft function (DGF), primary graft dysfunction (PGD)
- **Organ quality deterioration:** Cannot reverse ischemic injury
- **Predictive uncertainty:** Donor quality not assessed until after transplantation

## 3. MACHINE PERFUSION (MP)

Machine perfusion is emerging technology where organs are actively perfused with oxygenated solution during preservation, enabling hypothermic or normothermic perfusion and continuous assessment.

### 3.1 Hypothermic Machine Perfusion (HMP)

#### Overview

**Definition:** Active perfusion of organ with oxygenated cold solution (typically 4-10°C)

**Mechanism of benefit over SCS:**
- **Oxygen delivery:** Continuous oxygenation (dissolved O2 in cold solution)
  - Partially restores aerobic metabolism
  - Reduces lactate accumulation (marker of anaerobic metabolism)
  - Reduces ROS generation (hypoxia-reperfusion injury prevented)

- **Flushing:** Continuous perfusion removes cellular debris, potassium accumulated during ischemia, coagulation factors

- **Clearance:** Lactate, hydrogen ions continuously removed

- **Metabolic support:** Glucose, substrates available; ATP levels partially restored

- **Functional assessment:** Flow rate, resistance, organ response can be monitored

#### HOPE (Hypothermic Oxygenated Perfusion)

**Specific machine perfusion technique:**
- Organ connected to proprietary perfusion circuit
- Cold (4-10°C), oxygenated solution (FiO2 100%) continuously recirculated
- Pump maintains pressure and flow
- Solution warmed to maintain temperature
- Duration: Until transplantation (hours to days in some protocols)

**Evidence for HOPE in kidney transplantation:**
- Prospective randomized trials show benefit vs. SCS:
  - **Reduced DGF:** 20-25% (HOPE) vs. 30-40% (SCS)
  - **Better 1-year graft function:** Higher GFR with HOPE
  - **Reduced rejection:** Some studies show lower rejection rates

**Evidence for HOPE in liver transplantation:**
- HOPE reduces ischemic cholangiopathy (ITBL) in extended criteria donor livers
  - **HOPE outcomes:** 10-15% ITBL incidence vs. 20-30% (SCS) in ECD livers
  - Better liver function recovery
  - Enables use of longer cold ischemia time (15-20 hours) with preservation of outcomes

**Cost and practical considerations:**
- Expensive equipment ($200,000-500,000 initial cost)
- Ongoing consumable costs (disposable circuits, solutions)
- Requires trained personnel
- Time-intensive (setup, monitoring, transport with equipment)
- Currently not widely available (limited centers)

### 3.2 Normothermic Machine Perfusion (NMP)

#### Overview

**Definition:** Active perfusion of organ with warm (37°C), oxygenated, blood-based solution

**Mechanism of benefit:**
- **Restoration of aerobic metabolism:** Normothermic temperature restores full metabolic rate
- **ATP regeneration:** Complete restoration possible (vs. partial in HMP)
- **Functional assessment:** Organ working at physiologic temperature; function assessable
- **Reversal of injury:** Potential to reverse some ischemic injury through metabolic support
- **Longer preservation window:** Potential for extended preservation (days) if perfusion maintained

**Key difference from HMP:**
- Hypothermic perfusion: Slows but doesn't eliminate ischemia; extends time window
- Normothermic perfusion: Restores organ function; potential for "organ reconditioning"

#### Normothermic Kidney Perfusion (NKP)

**Technique:**
- Kidney connected to portable perfusion circuit
- Warm (37°C), oxygenated solution (blood-based) perfuses via renal artery
- Continuous monitoring: Flow, oxygen consumption, creatinine clearance, urine output
- Duration: Variable (hours to days)

**Clinical data (emerging):**
- Pilot studies show:
  - Better recovery of renal function vs. SCS
  - Ability to assess viability (oxygen consumption, urine output indicate viable kidney)
  - Potential to extend preservation window (preservation for 24+ hours with maintained function)
  - Possible reversal of delayed graft function risk

**Challenges:**
- Equipment cost (expensive; $500,000+)
- Complexity: Requires trained technician, continuous monitoring
- Transport: Equipment portable but cumbersome
- Solution preparation: Blood-based solution required
- Current status: Investigational; not standard of care yet

---

### 3.3 Subnormothermic Perfusion (20-32°C)

**Intermediate approach:**
- Organ perfused at temperature between hypothermia (4°C) and normothermia (37°C)
- Goal: Partial metabolic restoration with some protective effects of hypothermia
- Less complexity than full normothermic perfusion
- May provide benefit in select organs (heart, lung)

**Evidence:** Limited; ongoing trials in lung transplantation
