# DOCUMENT 1: ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION IMMUNOLOGY: ALLOIMMUNIZATION AND HLA MATCHING

## Executive Summary

The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is the primary determinant of transplant immunogenicity. Donor-recipient HLA mismatches trigger alloimmunization—the development of T-cell and B-cell mediated immune responses that result in rejection. This foundational document explains the HLA system, mechanisms of alloimmunization, modern matching strategies including eplet analysis, and sensitization prevention protocols. Understanding HLA-driven alloimmunity is essential to all downstream immunosuppressive strategy, desensitization protocols, and organ-specific rejection management.

## 1. THE HLA SYSTEM: STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

### 1.1 Overview of HLA Molecules

The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) system is the most polymorphic genetic system in humans, with >25,000 identified HLA alleles[1]. Despite this extreme diversity, only 60-70 of the most frequently occurring alleles are typically considered for organ transplantation compatibility testing[1]. The HLA system comprises two major classes:

**HLA Class I molecules** (HLA-A, -B, -C) are expressed on all nucleated cells and present intracellular peptides to CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). These molecules consist of a polymorphic α-chain, β2-microglobulin, and bound peptide.

**HLA Class II molecules** (HLA-DR, -DQ, -DP) are expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells (dendritic cells, B cells, macrophages) and present exogenous peptides to CD4+ helper T cells. Class II molecules consist of α and β chains, both of which are polymorphic.

The peptide-binding region (PBR) of HLA molecules contains the most polymorphic amino acid positions. These positions determine which peptides can bind and be presented to T cells, fundamentally shaping the immune response to the transplanted organ.

### 1.2 HLA Gene Organization and Inheritance

HLA genes are located on chromosome 6 in a region spanning approximately 3.6 megabases. This region contains genes for:
- Classical HLA molecules (Class I, Class II)
- Complement components (C2, C4, Factor B)
- Heat shock proteins
- Other immunologically relevant molecules

HLA genes show **haplotype inheritance**—the alleles at HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, -DQ, and -DP are inherited together as a block on each chromosome from each parent[2]. This linkage disequilibrium is critical for organ allocation and desensitization planning.

### 1.3 HLA Typing and Resolution Levels

Modern HLA typing utilizes molecular methods with varying resolution:

- **Low resolution (2-digit typing)**: Identifies HLA serologic groups (e.g., HLA-A02)
- **Intermediate resolution (4-digit typing)**: Identifies alleles within a serologic group (e.g., HLA-A*02:01)
- **High resolution (6-8 digit typing)**: Distinguishes alleles differing only at silent nucleotide positions
- **Ultra-high resolution (whole exome/genome sequencing)**: Complete characterization of HLA diversity including non-classical HLA molecules

For transplant purposes, **HLA-A, -B, and -DR at 4-digit resolution** have historically been the standard. However, emerging evidence supports the importance of HLA-DQ typing and non-classical HLA molecules.

## 2. HLA MISMATCHING AND ALLOIMMUNIZATION

### 2.1 Mechanisms of HLA-Driven Alloimmunization

Alloimmunization occurs when the transplant recipient's immune system recognizes donor HLA molecules as foreign and mounts an adaptive immune response. Three main pathways of HLA allorecognition operate:

#### Direct Allorecognition
In the direct pathway, recipient T cells directly recognize intact donor HLA molecules on donor antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that persist in the transplant[3]. This is the dominant pathway in acute rejection and is particularly effective because intact donor HLA/peptide complexes can activate high frequencies of recipient T cells (0.1-10% of circulating T cells recognize allogeneic HLA). The direct pathway is especially important early post-transplant when donor lymphoid cells are present.

#### Indirect Allorecognition
In the indirect pathway, recipient APCs process and present peptides derived from donor HLA molecules (and other alloantigen) in the context of recipient HLA to recipient T cells[3]. This pathway becomes increasingly important over time as donor APCs disappear and mimics the response to exogenous antigens (such as infectious pathogens). The indirect pathway is thought to be primarily responsible for chronic rejection through activation of helper T cells that license B cells to produce donor-specific antibodies (DSA).

#### Semi-direct Allorecognition
In the semi-direct pathway, recipient APCs acquire intact allogeneic HLA molecules from dying donor cells or APCs and present them at the cell surface. This hybrid pathway may explain certain aspects of B-cell activation and antibody production.

### 2.2 B-Cell Activation and Donor-Specific Antibody (DSA) Formation

The development of donor-specific antibodies (DSA) is a hallmark of alloimmunization. This process involves:

1. **T-cell help**: CD4+ helper T cells (particularly Tfh cells in germinal centers) provide interleukin-21 and CD40-CD40L signals to B cells recognizing donor HLA.

2. **B-cell activation and clonal selection**: B cells specific for donor HLA undergo proliferation and selection in germinal centers within secondary lymphoid organs.

3. **Affinity maturation**: Through somatic hypermutation and selection, B-cell receptors with higher affinity for donor HLA are generated.

4. **Plasma cell differentiation and memory formation**: Some B cells differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells; others become long-lived memory B cells.

The classes of DSA produced follow a pattern:
- **IgM DSA**: Often transient, may appear early after sensitization (e.g., transfusion, pregnancy)
- **IgG DSA**: More persistent, consist of subclasses IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 with varying complement-fixing ability
- **IgA DSA**: Less well characterized but increasingly recognized as potentially pathogenic

The presence and persistence of DSA is a major risk factor for antibody-mediated rejection (AMR).

## 3. CLINICAL IMPACT OF HLA MISMATCHING

### 3.1 HLA Mismatch Burden and Rejection Risk

Multiple studies have established a clear correlation between HLA mismatch degree and rejection risk[1]:

**Conventional (broad antigen) HLA mismatching:**
- A one-locus mismatch at HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-DR increases acute rejection risk incrementally
- Compared to zero-antigen mismatches (perfect match), each additional mismatch at HLA-A/B/DR increases acute rejection risk
- The effect is most pronounced in first-time transplant recipients
- Recipients >60 years may show less mismatch-related rejection (possibly due to age-related immune senescence)

**HLA-DQ mismatching:**
- DQ mismatches are independently associated with acute rejection regardless of HLA-ABDR matching[1]
- Two-allele DQ mismatches carry a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.85 (95% CI 1.05-7.75) for acute rejection
- The importance of DQ was underappreciated in earlier eras due to incomplete typing

**Long-term outcomes:**
- Better HLA matches are associated with improved graft survival beyond acute rejection prevention
- Zero-antigen HLA mismatched kidneys from living donors achieve median graft survival of 19+ years
- Each additional HLA mismatch is associated with reduced long-term graft half-life

### 3.2 Eplet Mismatching: Beyond Broad Antigen Matching

Traditional HLA matching focuses on mismatches at the level of whole HLA antigens. However, the actual immunogenic determinants on HLA molecules are much smaller structures called **epitopes** and specifically **eplets** (clusters of amino acids that form antibody binding sites).

#### Definition and Identification

Eplets are defined as short amino acid sequences (typically 5-8 amino acids) on the HLA molecule surface that can be recognized by HLA-specific antibodies. The concept has evolved from:
- **Monoclonal antibody studies** identifying discrete epitopes
- **Human alloantibody analysis** showing fine specificity
- **Computational immunology** predicting eplet mismatches from HLA sequences[4]

Recent algorithms (e.g., HLAmatch, PIRCHE) compute eplet incompatibility from donor-recipient HLA typing by comparing amino acid sequences.

#### Clinical Significance

Studies demonstrate that **eplet mismatch load predicts rejection risk independently of conventional HLA mismatches**[4]:

- Senev et al. found that eplet mismatch load was associated with:
  - Increased de novo DSA (dnDSA) formation
  - Higher rates of T-cell-mediated rejection (5% increased odds per mismatch)
  - Higher rates of antibody-mediated rejection (12% increased odds per mismatch)
  - Graft failure

- In recipients considered "low risk" by traditional matching (0-2 HLA-ABDR antigen mismatches), those with ≥20 eplet mismatches had adjusted HR 1.85 (95% CI 1.11-3.08) for rejection vs. those with <20 eplet mismatches

- DQ eplet mismatches are particularly immunogenic

#### Clinical Application

Eplet matching is increasingly incorporated into:
- Living donor selection (choosing the donor with lowest eplet mismatch)
- Kidney paired donation programs (finding compatible pairs with reduced eplet incompatibility)
- Organ allocation algorithms (incorporating eplet mismatch scores)
- Risk stratification for induction immunosuppression intensity

## 4. SENSITIZATION: CAUSES AND MECHANISMS

### 4.1 Pre-transplant Sensitization

Approximately 20% of kidney transplant candidates have circulating HLA-specific antibodies, meaning they have been sensitized to HLA antigens before transplantation[1]. This sensitization results from:

#### Blood Transfusions
Transfused red blood cells and platelets express HLA antigens (Class I on RBCs, both Class I and II on platelets). Transfusion-related HLA sensitization is less common in the modern era due to leukoreduction of blood products and widespread use of immunosuppression.

#### Pregnancy
Maternal-fetal trafficking of fetal HLA-incompatible cells can induce maternal anti-HLA responses. Multiparity is associated with increased HLA sensitization. The risk is higher with male fetuses (higher fetal hemoglobin containing maternal HLA+ white blood cells crossing the placenta).

#### Prior Organ Transplantation
Previous allograft recipients have the highest sensitization rates. This results from both:
- Deliberate or incidental immunization from the prior graft
- Failed grafts with chronic rejection where ongoing HLA exposure perpetuates alloimmunization

#### Other Sources
- Peritoneal dialysate (in peritoneal dialysis patients)
- Hemodialysis (unclear mechanism; possibly through dialysis membranes or transfusions given during dialysis)

### 4.2 Pre-transplant Panel Reactive Antibody (PRA) Testing

**Panel Reactive Antibody (PRA)** percentage represents the proportion of a donor panel (usually 60-100 representative HLA-typed donors) against which a patient has detectable antibodies. PRA testing identifies sensitized candidates and helps predict crossmatch compatibility:

- **PRA 0-20%**: Low sensitization; most donors acceptable
- **PRA 20-79%**: Moderate sensitization; many donors unsuitable
- **PRA ≥80%**: Highly sensitized; very limited donor pool

More sophisticated approaches now use **calculated PRA (cPRA)**—a computer algorithm that predicts the percentage of all possible donors with whom a patient would have a positive crossmatch based on their specific HLA antibodies, accounting for HLA antigen frequencies in the donor population.

### 4.3 Post-transplant Sensitization: De Novo DSA Formation

Even recipients without pre-transplant DSA can develop **de novo DSA (dnDSA)** after transplantation through ongoing HLA exposure. dnDSA formation is a major risk factor for chronic AMR and graft loss. Risk factors for dnDSA include:

- HLA mismatching (stronger for Class II than Class I mismatches)
- Higher eplet mismatch burden
- Non-adherence to immunosuppression
- Acute cellular rejection episodes (which increase HLA expression)
- Reduced immunosuppression intensity
- Pregnancy

The timing and persistence of dnDSA varies:
- Early dnDSA (within first year) may be more aggressive
- dnDSA detected 3+ years post-transplant indicates ongoing alloimmunization despite immunosuppression

## 5. HLA CROSSMATCHING

### 5.1 Definition and Purpose

HLA crossmatching is the process of testing recipient serum (or plasma) against donor lymphocytes to detect pre-formed antibodies against donor HLA. A positive crossmatch historically meant a contraindication to transplantation due to extreme risk of hyperacute rejection.

### 5.2 Crossmatch Methodologies

#### Complement-Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC) Crossmatch
This classical method incubates recipient serum with donor lymphocytes in the presence of complement. A positive test (cell lysis) indicates presence of cytotoxic antibodies. This is now rarely performed due to lack of sensitivity.

#### Flow Cytometry Crossmatch
More sensitive than CDC. Recipient serum is incubated with donor cells (T cells and B cells sorted) and then stained with fluorescently labeled anti-human immunoglobulin antibodies. Positive flow cytometry indicates binding of recipient antibodies to donor cells.

**Clinical interpretation:**
- T-cell positive, B-cell negative: Likely anti-HLA Class I
- T-cell positive, B-cell positive: Could be anti-HLA Class I or II, or anti-MICA/MICB
- B-cell positive, T-cell negative: Likely anti-HLA Class II or endothelial antigens

#### Single Antigen Bead Assay
Now the gold standard for HLA antibody detection. Luminex-based assays use microspheres coated with individual recombinant HLA antigens. Recipient serum is incubated with these beads; positive results (binding of IgG or IgM) are detected by fluorescence. This method:
- Identifies specific HLA antigens against which antibodies exist
- Quantifies antibody strength (mean fluorescence intensity, MFI)
- Distinguishes HLA Class I from Class II antibodies
- Detects both IgG and IgM
- Provides data for eplet matching

#### Virtual Crossmatch
A computational approach: if single antigen bead testing shows no donor-specific antibodies (DSA) and donor HLA typing is known, the likelihood of a negative crossmatch is very high. Virtual crossmatch reduces the need for tissue typing and can facilitate faster organ allocation.

### 5.3 Interpretation and Clinical Decision-Making

**Pre-transplant crossmatch results:**
- **Negative crossmatch**: Safe to proceed with transplantation (barring non-HLA antibodies)
- **Positive crossmatch**: Historically contraindicated. However, modern desensitization protocols have made ABO-incompatible and HLA-incompatible transplantation feasible

**Donor-specific antibody (DSA) presence and MFI:**
- Low MFI DSA (<2000 MFI) may carry lower risk
- High MFI DSA (>5000 MFI) carries substantial AMR risk
- IgG DSA is more concerning than IgM (more stable, better complement fixing)
- IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses are more complement-fixing than IgG2/IgG4

## 6. HLA MATCHING IN LIVING VS. DECEASED DONOR TRANSPLANTATION

### 6.1 Living Donor Transplantation

In living donation, there is opportunity to **select among potential donors** based on HLA compatibility. Strategies include:

#### HLA-Compatible Living Donor Selection
When multiple related or unrelated donors are available, the donor with the lowest HLA (or eplet) mismatch is chosen. This results in:
- Better short-term graft survival
- Reduced rejection rates
- Improved long-term outcomes
- Reduced immunosuppression requirements

#### Kidney Paired Donation (KPD) Programs
KPD programs enroll incompatible donor-recipient pairs and facilitate exchanges to find compatible matches. A multi-center study found that:
- 26.9% of enrolled pairs were otherwise compatible (meaning the donor and recipient were HLA-compatible despite potential blood type incompatibility or other factors)
- More than half successfully received an equivalent or better HLA match through the exchange[1]

#### HLA Eplet-Optimized Living Donor Selection
Increasingly, living donor selection incorporates eplet mismatch minimization. Simulations show that eplet mismatch loads can be significantly reduced through paired kidney donation programs, even when broad HLA antigen mismatches seem comparable between candidate pairs.

### 6.2 Deceased Donor Transplantation

In deceased donation, the degree of HLA mismatch is **not modifiable**. However, HLA data guides:

- **Induction immunosuppression intensity**: More intense induction (e.g., lymphocyte-depleting agents) for higher mismatch
- **Maintenance immunosuppression targets**: Higher CNI troughs for higher mismatch burden
- **Baseline risk stratification**: Combined with other factors (age, race, prior transplant) to predict rejection risk
- **Allocation algorithms**: OPTN/UNOS kidney allocation system incorporates HLA mismatch into priority scoring

---

## 7. NON-HLA ALLOIMMUNITY

### 7.1 Non-HLA Antigens and Alloantibodies

While HLA-driven alloimmunity is the primary determinant of rejection, mounting evidence demonstrates that **non-HLA donor-recipient mismatches** also contribute to allograft injury:

#### Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I-Related Chain A (MICA) and MICB
MICA and MICB are stress-inducible molecules with limited polymorphism. MICA-specific antibodies develop in ~10-15% of sensitized transplant recipients and are associated with:
- Acute and chronic AMR
- Graft vasculopathy
- Reduced graft survival

#### Endothelial Antigens
Various endothelial antigens (e.g., vimentin, perlecan, collagen) can be targets of non-HLA antibodies and may contribute to chronic rejection through molecular mimicry or cross-reactivity with HLA.

#### ABO System
ABO blood group antigens are expressed on endothelial cells. ABO incompatibility was historically a contraindication but is now manageable through desensitization protocols.

### 7.2 Clinical Implications

Non-HLA antibody-mediated rejection is characterized by:
- Graft injury despite negative HLA crossmatch
- Presence of non-HLA DSA on testing
- Microvascular inflammation on graft biopsy
- Variable response to standard AMR therapy

Currently, there are **limited diagnostic and therapeutic tools** for non-HLA alloimmunity, making prevention through best HLA matching and optimization of immunosuppression the primary strategy.

## 8. DESENSITIZATION PROTOCOLS FOR INCOMPATIBLE TRANSPLANTATION

### 8.1 Overview and Rationale

Desensitization is the process of reducing anti-donor HLA antibodies before transplantation to permit transplantation of otherwise incompatible donor-recipient pairs. The rationale includes:

- Highly sensitized patients (cPRA >80-98%) have extremely limited donor pools
- Long waiting times on dialysis increase mortality and morbidity
- Desensitization can expand the pool of compatible donors
- Modern desensitization protocols have demonstrated 5-year graft survival rates of 70-80%

### 8.2 Desensitization Strategies

#### Antibody Removal
- **Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE)**: Removes circulating immunoglobulins, including HLA-specific antibodies. Typically 5-10 exchanges remove 60-80% of IgG.
- **Immunoadsorption**: More selective removal of HLA-specific antibodies using columns coated with HLA antigens or protein A (which binds immunoglobulin Fc regions).

#### B-Cell and Plasma Cell Reduction
- **Rituximab**: Chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibody against CD20 (B-cell surface antigen). Depletes B cells and some memory B cells, reducing DSA-producing cells.
- **Bortezomib**: Proteasome inhibitor that targets plasma cells. Used in some centers for proteasome inhibitor-based desensitization.

#### Immunoglobulin Replacement
- **Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)**: Polyclonal human immunoglobulin. Mechanisms include:
  - Provides normal IgG to replace removed antibodies
  - Anti-idiotype effects (anti-HLA antibodies in IVIG may bind recipient anti-HLA antibodies)
  - Complement modulation
  - B-cell signaling effects

### 8.3 Desensitization Protocol Examples

Different centers employ varied protocols. Common approaches include:

#### Protocol 1: Moderate Intensity
- Monthly IVIG infusions (2 g/kg) × 3-4 months
- Goal: Reduce pre-transplant MFI by 50%+

#### Protocol 2: Intensive
- 2 g/kg IVIG
- Followed by 5-10 therapeutic plasma exchange treatments
- Rituximab 1-2 doses (375-500 mg/m²)
- Goal: Achieve negative crossmatch before transplantation

#### Protocol 3: Very Intensive (Rapidly Incompatible)
- More frequent plasmapheresis (2-3 times weekly)
- Higher-dose rituximab
- Monoclonal anti-C1q or eculizumab (complement inhibition)
- Used when baseline DSA is very high or urgent transplantation needed

### 8.4 Emerging Desensitization Agents

**Eculizumab (complement C5 inhibitor)**
- Blocks terminal complement pathway (C5a, C5b-9 formation)
- May prevent antibody-mediated cellular injury even if DSA present
- One study found no difference vs. standard desensitization at 9 weeks post-transplant

**Tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor antagonist)**
- Blocks IL-6 signaling, important in B-cell maturation and Tfh cell differentiation
- French study found tocilizumab equivalent to standard apheresis + rituximab for pre-transplant DSA reduction

**Imlifidase (IgG-degrading enzyme)**
- Cleaves human IgG at hinge region, inactivating antibodies
- Rapid reduction of DSA, even achievement of negative crossmatch after treatment
- Concerns: DSA rebound post-transplant, anti-imlifidase antibody formation
- Current role limited; more data needed

**Monoclonal antibodies against HLA-specific B cells**
- Novel agents targeting B-cell receptors specific for donor HLA
- Still in development/clinical trials

### 8.5 Outcomes of Desensitization

**Long-term graft survival in desensitized recipients:**
- 5-year allograft survival: 70-86% (compared to 59% in those who remained on dialysis)
- Acute rejection rates: Similar to conventional transplant recipients after successful desensitization
- Chronic rejection/graft dysfunction: Variable; some studies show more dnDSA formation

**Factors predicting desensitization success:**
- Lower baseline DSA (MFI <3000 more favorable than >5000)
- Better HLA matching even within incompatible pairs
- Younger recipients
- Absence of prior non-HLA sensitization

## 9. CLINICAL APPLICATION: HLA MATCHING STRATEGIES

### 9.1 Pre-transplant Optimization

1. **Obtain high-resolution HLA typing** for both donor and recipient
2. **Perform single-antigen bead antibody testing** to identify specific DSA
3. **Calculate eplet mismatch load** using appropriate algorithm
4. **Assess immunologic risk** based on:
   - PRA/cPRA
   - Prior transplant status
   - Race/ethnicity (influences HLA frequency and immunogenicity perception)
   - HLA mismatch degree
   - Eplet mismatch load
5. **Proceed with appropriate desensitization** if indicated
6. **Plan induction and maintenance immunosuppression** intensity based on risk

### 9.2 Organ Allocation Considerations

Modern UNOS/OPTN kidney allocation algorithms incorporate:
- Calculated Panel Reactive Antibody (cPRA): Higher cPRA increases priority
- HLA Mismatch Score: Better matches weighted higher
- Geographic factors
- Time on waiting list
- Age compatibility

Future allocation systems may incorporate eplet mismatch and non-HLA factors.

## 10. SUMMARY AND KEY CONCEPTS

### Key Points

1. **HLA mismatching is the primary immune barrier**: Donor-recipient HLA incompatibility triggers alloimmunization and rejection. Better HLA matching improves both acute and long-term outcomes.

2. **Eplet matching is more precise than broad antigen matching**: Eplet mismatch load predicts rejection risk independently and is increasingly used for living donor selection and allocation.

3. **Sensitization is common and impactful**: ~20% of transplant candidates have pre-formed HLA antibodies from transfusion, pregnancy, or prior transplant. Even low-level pre-transplant DSA doubles AMR risk.

4. **De novo DSA formation is a major threat**: Post-transplant HLA alloimmunization despite immunosuppression contributes significantly to chronic rejection and graft loss.

5. **Desensitization expands the donor pool**: Modern protocols enable successful ABO-incompatible and HLA-incompatible transplantation in highly sensitized candidates.

6. **Non-HLA alloimmunity is emerging**: MICA, endothelial, and other non-HLA antibodies contribute to rejection but have limited diagnostic/therapeutic options.
