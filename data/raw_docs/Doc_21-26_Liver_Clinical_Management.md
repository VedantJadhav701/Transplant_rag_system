# DOCUMENTS 21-26: LIVER TRANSPLANT - COMPREHENSIVE CLINICAL MANAGEMENT

## [DOCUMENT 21: POST-OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT & EARLY COMPLICATIONS]

### Executive Summary
Post-operative liver transplant management focuses on monitoring graft function, preventing early complications, and optimizing immunosuppression. Early complications include primary graft dysfunction, vascular thrombosis, biliary complications, and infectious diseases. Immunosuppression induction typically uses higher-intensity protocols than kidney transplant, with corticosteroid boluses, CNI, antimetabolite, and often induction therapy.

### Key Content Areas:
- **Early graft assessment:** INR trends, liver enzymes, bile quality
- **Hemodynamic management:** Fluid optimization, vasoactive support
- **Immunosuppression initiation:** Induction agents, CNI dosing, drug interactions
- **Infection prevention:** CMV prophylaxis (D+R−), PCP, fungal, bacterial
- **Early complication diagnosis & management:**
  - Primary graft dysfunction (PGD): Definition, treatment, outcomes
  - Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT): <2% incidence; ischemic necrosis of bile duct
  - Portal vein thrombosis: Rare; usually graft-losing
  - Bile leak: 1-2%; managed by ERCP ± stenting + drain
  - Hemorrhage: 5-10% require re-exploration
  - Acute rejection: 15-20% incidence; steroid-responsive
- **Coagulopathy management:** Fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, platelets
- **Nutritional support:** Early enteral nutrition preferred
- **Drain management:** Output, character, timing of removal

## [DOCUMENT 22: ACUTE REJECTION & MANAGEMENT]

### Executive Summary
Acute rejection occurs in 15-20% of liver transplant recipients, with better prognosis than kidney/heart transplants. Histologic acute rejection (portal infiltration, bile duct damage, endotheliitis) is distinguished from clinical rejection (symptoms). T-cell mediated rejection predominates; antibody-mediated rejection less common than kidney. Corticosteroid pulse is effective first-line therapy; refractory cases treated with rATG or rituximab.

### Key Content Areas:
- **Epidemiology:** 15-20% incidence; peaks week 1-4 post-transplant
- **Risk factors:** HLA mismatch, non-adherence, lower CNI levels
- **Clinical presentation:** Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP), elevated bilirubin, fever (uncommon)
- **Diagnostic approach:**
  - **Liver biopsy:** Gold standard; shows portal inflammation, bile duct damage, endothelial inflammation
  - **Banff classification:** Grade 0-3 based on severity
  - **Biopsy necessary:** Distinguish rejection from other causes (CMV, drug toxicity, PVT, others)
  
- **Management:**
  - **Corticosteroid pulse:** 500-1000 mg IV methylprednisolone daily × 3-5 days
  - **Success rate:** 70-80% respond to steroids
  - **rATG:** For steroid-resistant (1.25 mg/kg × 7-14 days)
  - **Rituximab:** B-cell depletion; limited liver rejection data vs. kidney
  - **CNI optimization:** Ensure therapeutic levels (not sub-therapeutic)
  - **No need to reduce CNI:** Unlike some rejection management; maintain or increase levels
  
- **Prognosis:**
  - Steroid-responsive rejection: Good outcomes; graft function recovers
  - Steroid-resistant: Worse prognosis; higher mortality but salvageable
  - **Late rejection:** Unusual in liver; if occurs, consider non-adherence

## [DOCUMENT 23: CHRONIC LIVER DISEASE & RECURRENT HEPATITIS]

### Executive Summary
Chronic rejection (chronic ductular rejection, ductopenia) is rare in liver (<5% incidence), contrasting with kidney and heart. More common issue is recurrent viral hepatitis (HCV, HBV) and disease progression. Fibrosis develops gradually with chronic injury; some patients develop cirrhosis in graft. Immunosuppression optimization and antiviral therapy critical.

### Key Content Areas:
- **Chronic rejection:** Uncommon (<5%); characterized by ductopenia, foam cell arteriopathy
  - Progressive fibrosis over years
  - Similar to chronic kidney rejection but lower incidence
  - Management: CNI optimization, maintain adequate IS

- **Recurrent hepatitis C (HCV):**
  - **Incidence:** Universal (100%) in HCV+ recipients without treatment
  - **Progression:** Variable (10-30% develop cirrhosis by 5 years; some stable)
  - **Outcomes:** HCV recurrence reduces graft survival vs. HCV− recipients
  - **Management:** Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy
    - Timing: Usually wait 3-6 months post-transplant (allow immune stabilization)
    - Efficacy: >95% sustained virologic response (SVR)
    - Benefits: Improved graft survival when HCV cured
    - Immunosuppression interactions: Minimal with newer DAAs
  
- **Recurrent hepatitis B (HBV):**
  - **Prevention:** HBIG (hepatitis B immunoglobulin) indefinitely + antivirals (entecavir, tenofovir)
  - **Incidence with prophylaxis:** <5% reinfection
  - **Without prophylaxis:** 75-80% reinfection
  - **Management if reinfection:** Enhance antivirals, consider lamivudine, adefovir resistance monitoring
  
- **Other viral recurrences:**
  - **HEV (hepatitis E):** Chronic infection possible in immunosuppressed; difficult to treat
  - **CMV:** Hepatitis rare; prophylaxis prevents

- **Disease progression factors:**
  - Age (older = faster progression)
  - Degree of immunosuppression (lower IS = faster progression)
  - Adherence (non-adherence = faster progression)
  - Co-infections (HBV/HCV co-infection = very aggressive)
  - Alcoholic liver disease recurrence: Alcohol use resumption leads to graft loss

## [DOCUMENT 24: HBV/HCV CO-INFECTION & MANAGEMENT]

### Executive Summary
Hepatitis B and C co-infected patients present complex management challenges. HBV/HCV co-infection accelerates fibrosis (3-4 year cirrhosis risk vs. 10+ years single infection). Antiviral therapy essential post-transplant. Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have revolutionized HCV management. HBV/HCV co-infected recipients and donors now considered acceptable with appropriate prophylaxis.

### Key Content Areas:
- **HBV/HCV co-infection epidemiology:**
  - 5-10% of HCV+ patients also HBV+
  - Higher in PWID (people who inject drugs), regions with endemic HBV
  - Accelerated liver fibrosis with co-infection
  
- **HBV/HCV co-infected donor policy:**
  - Previously contraindication
  - Now: Acceptable to HBV/HCV co-infected recipient with antiviral coverage
  - Requires: Hepatology/ID specialist consultation
  
- **Recipient management (HBV/HCV co-infected):**
  - **HBV prophylaxis:** HBIG + antivirals (entecavir or tenofovir)
  - **HCV treatment:** DAAs after transplant (typically 3-6 months wait)
  - **Drug interactions:** Monitor between IS and antivirals
  - **Outcomes:** Improved significantly with DAA therapy
  
- **Sequential treatment approach:**
  - Stabilize transplant first (3-6 months)
  - Then initiate HCV DAA therapy
  - Monitor closely for interactions, hepatotoxicity
  
- **Special populations:**
  - **HIV-positive co-infected:** Additional complexity; IS/ART interactions
  - **Renal dysfunction:** Adjust DAA dosing if eGFR <30

## [DOCUMENT 25: CHOLESTASIS & ISCHEMIC CHOLANGIOPATHY (ITBL)]

### Executive Summary
Ischemic-type biliary lesions (ITBL) represent a major cause of graft failure in later years. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) of the graft results from ischemic injury to bile ducts. Intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct strictures develop (1-15% incidence depending on risk factors). Machine perfusion (HOPE) has shown promise in reducing ITBL in extended criteria donor livers.

### Key Content Areas:
- **Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) of allograft:**
  - Definition: Fibrosis/stricturing of bile ducts (donor or native)
  - Incidence: 1-15% (higher in ECD, DCD, longer ischemia)
  - Pathogenesis: Ischemic injury to bile duct epithelium
  - Progressive: Can lead to graft cirrhosis
  
- **Risk factors for ITBL:**
  - DCD donation (highest risk; 15%+)
  - Extended criteria donor (older, higher transaminases)
  - Long cold ischemia time (>12 hours significantly increases)
  - Donor age >70
  - Elevated AST/ALT pre-transplant
  - Negative: Liver biopsy steatosis not independently protective
  
- **Clinical presentation:**
  - Often asymptomatic (found on surveillance imaging)
  - Elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
  - Cholangitis (if stricture severe)
  - Progressive graft dysfunction
  
- **Diagnosis:**
  - **Imaging:** Ultrasound (dilated ducts) → MRCP (gold standard; shows strictures)
  - **Laboratory:** Elevated ALP, GGT; elevated bilirubin if obstruction
  - **Biopsy:** Shows fibrosis, duct loss (ductopenia)
  
- **Management:**
  - **Early (single stricture):** ERCP with sphincterotomy ± stent (can delay/prevent progression)
  - **Progressive:** Options limited; retransplantation if severe
  - **Medical:** No proven preventive therapy (ursodeoxycholic acid ineffective)
  - **Surgical:** Transplantectomy if severe with liver failure
  
- **Prevention:**
  - Minimize cold ischemia time
  - Machine perfusion (HOPE) reduces risk in ECD (emerging evidence)
  - Careful matching of ECD kidneys with lower-MELD recipients (less risk tolerance)

## [DOCUMENT 26: OUTCOMES, ALLOCATION EQUITY, AND SPECIAL POPULATIONS]

### Executive Summary
Liver transplant outcomes have improved significantly with modern immunosuppression and antiviral therapy. Median graft survival is 12-15 years for deceased donor, superior for living donor (20+ years). Mortality within first year (5-10%) highest in transplant. Long-term outcomes limited by chronic rejection (rare), recurrent disease, and comorbidities. Allocation strategies balance utility (sickest-first via MELD) with equity concerns (HCC priority, geographic fairness).

### Key Content Areas:
- **Outcomes by etiology:**
  - **HCV:** Historical poor outcomes; now excellent with DAAs
  - **ALD:** 5-year survival 80%; recurrence 10-20%
  - **HBV:** Excellent (>80% at 5 years) with HBIG + antivirals
  - **HCC:** 70-80% at 5 years within Milan criteria
  - **Cholestasis (PBC, PSC):** Excellent (>80-85% at 5 years)
  - **Autoimmune:** Very good (>85% at 5 years)

- **Survival analysis:**
  - **Patient survival:** 1-year ~88%, 5-year ~75%, 10-year ~60%
  - **Graft survival:** 1-year ~85%, 5-year ~70%, 10-year ~50%
  - **Median half-life:** ~12-15 years (deceased); 20+ years (living)
  - **Death with functioning graft:** 50% of "graft losses" = death, not graft failure

- **MELD-based allocation equity:**
  - **Sickest-first principle:** Reduces mortality on waiting list
  - **HCC exceptions:** Controversial; some argue prioritizes less-sick patients over sicker non-HCC
  - **Geographic variation:** Some regions longer waits than others
  - **Policy evolution:** Continuous review to balance utility + equity

- **Special populations:**
  - **Elderly (>65 years):** Generally good candidates; outcomes reasonable
  - **Pediatric:** Excellent outcomes (>90% at 5 years); ABO-incompatible increasing
  - **Re-transplantation:** Worse outcomes (graft half-life ~8 years vs. ~12-15 first transplant)
  - **Hepatocellular carcinoma:** Expanding criteria beyond Milan; longer waits
  - **Living donor:** Excellent outcomes; planned surgery advantage; can select lower-MELD recipients

- **Quality metrics:**
  - **Graft survival vs. center:** Large variation; volume matters (high-volume centers better)
  - **Donor-recipient matching:** Better matching = better outcomes
  - **Immunosuppression protocol:** Modern triple therapy superior to older regimens
