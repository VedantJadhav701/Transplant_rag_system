# DOCUMENTS 36-42: PANCREAS & INTESTINE TRANSPLANTATION

## [DOCUMENT 36: PANCREAS TRANSPLANT - INDICATIONS & EVALUATION]

### Executive Summary
Pancreas transplantation offers cure of diabetes (euglycemia without exogenous insulin) and is indicated for Type 1 diabetes mellitus with end-stage renal disease (SPK - simultaneous pancreas-kidney) or isolated pancreas transplant (PTA) in select candidates. Pancreas-after-kidney (PAK) transplant occurs after prior successful kidney transplant. Patient selection critical—complications higher than other solid organs; careful risk-benefit analysis required.

### Key Content Areas:
**Indications:**
- **SPK (simultaneous pancreas-kidney):** Type 1 DM + ESRD; most common (80% of pancreas transplants)
  - 1-year graft survival: kidney ~95%, pancreas ~88%
  - 5-year graft survival: kidney ~85%, pancreas ~70%
  - Outcomes excellent; kidney improves with pancreas function
  
- **PAK (pancreas-after-kidney):** Type 1 DM; prior kidney transplant success
  - 1-year graft survival: ~85%
  - Less common (~15% of pancreas transplants)
  
- **PTA (pancreas transplant alone):** Type 1 DM; no renal disease
  - Rare (~5% of pancreas transplants)
  - Reserved for:
    - Brittle diabetes (severe hypoglycemic unawareness, recurrent DKA)
    - Hypoglycemic episodes despite CGMS
    - Significant quality-of-life impairment
  
**Candidate selection (Type 1 DM criteria):**
- Duration of diabetes typically >20 years
- HbA1c <7% despite maximal IS therapy (some protocols)
- C-peptide negative/low (confirms Type 1)
- Age <50-60 years (some centers older)
- No significant CAD (stress test/angiography if risk factors)
- Adequate renal function (for SPK/PAK)
- Motivation for lifelong IS + frequent monitoring

**Absolute contraindications:**
- Type 2 diabetes (high recurrence)
- Uncontrolled psychiatric illness
- Active substance abuse
- Severe CAD unsuitable for surgery
- Severe hepatic/renal disease (other than DM-related)
- Malignancy (recent/active)

**Benefits of pancreas transplant vs. insulin:**
- Euglycemia (normal blood glucose without exogenous insulin)
- Improved renal function (if SPK; kidney graft protected from hyperglycemia)
- Prevention of DM complications (retinopathy progression slows; some reversal possible)
- Quality of life improvement (freedom from insulin injections, glucose monitoring)
- Improved cardiovascular outcomes (some studies suggest benefit)
- Lifespan improvement (debated; some studies show longevity benefit)

## [DOCUMENT 37: PANCREAS TRANSPLANT - DONOR EVALUATION & PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT]

### Executive Summary
Pancreas donor quality critical; organ sensitive to ischemic injury. Standard criteria donors preferred (younger, BMI <30, limited comorbidities). Extended criteria donors increasingly used due to organ shortage. Perioperative management emphasizes careful vascular dissection, preservation, and reconstruction. Anastomotic thrombosis most common complication (requiring urgent diagnosis).

### Key Content Areas:
**Donor evaluation:**
- Age <50 preferred; >60 marginal
- BMI <30 ideal; >35 concerning
- No diabetes (obvious exclusion)
- No pancreatic disease (pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis)
- AST/ALT normal
- Hemodynamically stable
- No extended ischemia (organ very sensitive to warm ischemia)

**Donor procurement:**
- **In situ flush:** Aortic cannulation; cold UW solution infused through SMA + celiac axis
- **Vascular dissection:** Careful; preserve all vessels (proper hepatic artery, SMA, portal vein, splenic vein)
- **Whole pancreas:** Usually entire pancreas + duodenum (attached) transplanted
- **Segmental pancreas:** Distal pancreas only (rare; higher thrombosis risk)

**Cold preservation:**
- **Solution:** UW (University of Wisconsin) preferred
- **Temperature:** 0-4°C
- **Ischemia time:** Goal <12 hours; >24 hours significantly increases dysfunction

**Pancreas transplant surgical technique:**
- **Vascular anastomoses:**
  - **Arterial:** Graft superior mesenteric + splenic arteries anastomosed to recipient (usually aorta or iliac artery; Y-graft commonly used)
  - **Venous:** Graft portal vein anastomosed to recipient (usually iliac vein)
  
- **Exocrine drainage (choice between 2 methods):**
  1. **Bladder drainage (classic):** Duodenum anastomosed to recipient bladder
     - Advantage: Easy biopsy if rejection (cystoscopic approach); technical ease
     - Disadvantage: Metabolic acidosis from urinary bicarbonate loss; chronic cystitis; UTI risk
     - Complication: Duodenitis from urine irritation
  
  2. **Enteric drainage (increasingly preferred):** Duodenum anastomosed to jejunal loop (Roux-en-Y)
     - Advantage: Physiologic; avoids urinary complications
     - Disadvantage: Biopsy requires laparoscopy/open surgery (more invasive)
     - Complication: Pancreatitis, fistula (less common than bladder complications)

**Site of transplant:**
- Usually right lower abdomen (iliac fossa)
- Sometimes left lower abdomen if right unsuitable

## [DOCUMENT 38: PANCREAS TRANSPLANT - POST-OPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS & MANAGEMENT]

### Executive Summary
Pancreas transplant has highest complication rate of solid organ transplants. Most common early complications include graft thrombosis, pancreatitis, and anastomotic leaks. Acute rejection occurs in 20-30% (similar to kidney). Immunosuppression typically uses stronger induction + maintenance than kidney alone. Long-term success requires vigilant monitoring and complication prevention.

### Key Content Areas:
**Early complications (first weeks-months):**

**Vascular thrombosis (most common; 5-10%):**
- **Arterial thrombosis:** More common than venous
- **Presentation:** Sudden elevation of glucose + amylase + lipase; graft pain
- **Diagnosis:** Doppler ultrasound (no flow); CT angiography
- **Risk factors:** Hypercoagulability, small vessels, young donor, prolonged ischemia
- **Management:** Urgent thrombectomy if within hours; otherwise graft loss inevitable
- **Prevention:** Aspirin ± other anticoagulation (protocols vary)

**Pancreatitis:**
- **Incidence:** 5-15% (self-limited) to 1-5% (severe, graft-losing)
- **Etiology:** Ischemic injury, reperfusion injury, handling during procurement
- **Presentation:** Elevated amylase/lipase; abdominal pain
- **Diagnosis:** CT, lipase elevation
- **Management:** Conservative (NPO, fluids); rarely necrotizing
- **Prevention:** Gentle handling, minimal ischemia time, appropriate preservation

**Anastomotic leak/fistula (2-5%):**
- **Location:** Vascular or enteric anastomosis
- **Presentation:** Fever, abdominal pain, peritonitis; drainage fluid from drain
- **Diagnosis:** Imaging, drain analysis
- **Management:** Surgical repair if salvageable; otherwise graft loss
- **Prevention:** Meticulous technique

**Bleeding (10-15%; often self-limited):**
- **Source:** Anastomotic, vascular, pancreatic parenchyma
- **Management:** Most resolve without intervention; some require re-exploration

**Acute rejection (20-30% incidence):**
- **Diagnosis:** Biopsy (if bladder-drained, cystoscopic duodenal biopsy; if enteric-drained, ultrasound-guided)
- **Management:** Pulse steroids ± rATG
- **Grading:** Similar Banff classification as kidney
- **Usually reversible** with treatment

**Immunosuppression post-pancreas:**
- **Induction:** Often more intense than kidney (rATG vs. basiliximab)
- **Maintenance:** Triple therapy (CNI, antimetabolite, steroid)
- **Target levels:** Often higher than kidney alone (concern for graft loss)

## [DOCUMENT 39: PANCREAS TRANSPLANT - OUTCOMES & SPECIAL TOPICS]

### Executive Summary
Pancreas transplant outcomes have improved significantly. SPK recipients have excellent outcomes comparable to kidney alone (due to kidney-protective effect of euglycemia). Long-term graft survival limited by chronic rejection and recurrent autoimmunity. Pancreas re-transplantation possible but higher risk. Quality-of-life benefits significant despite complications.

### Key Content Areas:
**Outcomes by transplant type:**

**SPK (simultaneous pancreas-kidney):**
- 1-year patient survival: 95-98%
- 1-year kidney graft survival: 95-98%
- 1-year pancreas graft survival: 88-92%
- 5-year patient survival: 80-85%
- 5-year kidney graft survival: 85-90%
- 5-year pancreas graft survival: 70-75%
- 10-year pancreas graft survival: 50-60% (median half-life ~15-17 years)

**PAK (pancreas-after-kidney):**
- 1-year pancreas graft survival: 85-90%
- 5-year: 65-70%
- Slightly worse than SPK (pre-existing kidney disease management)

**PTA (pancreas transplant alone):**
- Rarer; similar outcomes to PAK
- Less common due to complications/limited indications

**Causes of graft loss:**
- Chronic rejection: 40-50%
- Recurrent autoimmunity: 10-20% (attack on new pancreas; rare but possible)
- Thrombosis: ~5%
- Infection: ~3-5%
- Other (technical, non-compliance): ~10%

**Quality-of-life outcomes:**
- Euglycemia achieved (average glucose 100-120 mg/dL)
- Insulin independence: 85-95% at 5 years
- Hypoglycemic episodes essentially eliminated
- Improved general well-being, freedom from injections
- Reduced fear of complications

**Bladder vs. enteric drainage outcomes:**
- **Bladder drainage:** Higher acute rejection rates (~35% vs. ~25%); metabolic acidosis in 40%
- **Enteric drainage:** Fewer complications long-term; increasingly preferred
- **Trend:** Conversion to enteric drainage if bladder complications develop

## [DOCUMENT 40: INTESTINE TRANSPLANT - INDICATIONS & OUTCOMES]

### Executive Summary
Intestine transplantation is rarest solid organ transplant (1-2% of all transplants). Indicated for intestinal failure (short bowel syndrome, pseudo-obstruction, motility disorders) when total parenteral nutrition (TPN) fails. Outcomes historically poor due to high rejection rates (most immunogenic organ). Modern immunosuppression has improved 5-year survival to ~50-60%. Reserved for carefully selected candidates.

### Key Content Areas:
**Indications for intestine transplant:**
- **Intestinal failure:** Loss of absorptive capacity requiring TPN indefinitely
- **Specific conditions:**
  - Short bowel syndrome (surgical resection, Crohn's disease, trauma)
  - Pseudo-obstruction (chronic; irreversible)
  - Congenital disorders (microvillus inclusion disease, intestinal aganglionosis)
  - Familial polyposis with prophylactic colectomy
  - Motility disorders (severe; refractory to medical therapy)

**TPN failure criteria (indication for transplant):**
- Recurrent sepsis from central line infections
- Loss of vascular access (thrombosis)
- Progressive hepatic disease from TPN (TPN-induced liver disease)
- Poor quality of life (permanent hospital dependence)
- Desire for independent nutrition (quality-of-life indication)

**Candidate selection (very strict):**
- Age: Wide range (pediatric to adult; depends on specific indication)
- Motivation: Must understand high complication rate
- Good social support: Essential (lifelong intensive management)
- Absence of severe comorbidities: Surgical risk must be acceptable
- Psychiatric stability: Stress of chronic complications
- **No active sepsis** at time of transplant (absolute contraindication)

**Absolute contraindications:**
- Malignancy (any active/recent)
- Active infection (especially fungal)
- Severe liver dysfunction (liver often involved in TPN complications)
- Psychiatric instability
- Lack of social support

**Outcomes:**
- **1-year patient survival:** 85-90%
- **5-year patient survival:** 60-70%
- **1-year graft survival:** 75-85%
- **5-year graft survival:** 50-60%
- **Most common cause of failure:** Chronic rejection (50%)
- **Acute rejection:** 70-80% incidence (very high; most immunogenic organ)

**Transplant types:**
- **Isolated intestine:** Small bowel only (simplest)
- **Multivisceral:** Intestine + liver + stomach ± pancreas (complex; sometimes necessary if multiple organs damaged)

**Quality of life post-transplant:**
- Independence from TPN (major benefit)
- Ability to eat orally (psychologically important)
- But significant morbidity from rejection, complications
- Not curative (median 5-7 years of graft function)

## [DOCUMENT 41: MULTI-ORGAN TRANSPLANTS (HEART-LUNG, KIDNEY-PANCREAS, KIDNEY-HEART, OTHER COMBINATIONS)]

### Executive Summary
Multi-organ transplants (beyond SPK) address multiple organ failures. Heart-lung transplants are performed for combined cardiopulmonary failure (Eisenmenger syndrome, primary pulmonary hypertension, CF with severe disease). Other rare combinations include kidney-heart (rare), kidney-liver (renal failure + cirrhosis), and others. Indications, outcomes, and management vary by combination.

### Key Content Areas:
**Heart-lung transplant:**
- Indications: Eisenmenger syndrome (uncorrectable), PPH, CF with cor pulmonale, complex congenital disease
- Outcomes: 5-year ~50-60% (similar to individual heart/lung but worse when combined)
- Allocation: High priority (Status 1A)
- Complications: Combined heart + lung rejection/complications

**Kidney-heart transplant:**
- Rare; indicated for ESRD + advanced CAD unsuitable for CABG
- Very few centers perform
- Outcomes: Limited data; challenging

**Kidney-liver transplant:**
- Indicated: ESRD + hepatic cirrhosis (HCV end-stage, autoimmune, others)
- Special consideration: Liver provides some immune tolerance benefit to kidney
- Outcomes: Better than expected (kidney benefits from liver)

**Pancreas-liver transplant:**
- Rare; Type 1 DM + liver disease
- Liver protects pancreas from some rejection

**Small bowel with other organs (multivisceral):**
- Intestine + liver ± pancreas ± spleen
- Highest complexity
- Outcomes: Poor (but necessary if multiple organs diseased)

## [DOCUMENT 42: PANCREAS/INTESTINE & RARE TRANSPLANTS - SPECIAL POPULATIONS & EMERGING]

### Executive Summary
Pediatric pancreas/intestine transplants present unique challenges (growth, adherence, technical considerations). Elderly candidates rare. Living pancreas donation (distal pancreas) emerging but limited. Re-transplantation for graft failure possible but risky. Xenotransplantation (pancreas) being explored. This document addresses special populations and emerging approaches in pancreas/intestine transplantation.

### Key Content Areas:
**Pediatric pancreas/intestine transplants:**
- Increasingly performed (improved outcomes with modern IS)
- Challenge: Growth (child grows; graft may become relatively small)
- Challenge: Long-term adherence (years of IS + monitoring)
- Intestine in pediatric: Often done for short-bowel syndrome from surgical complications
- Outcomes: Reasonable with experienced centers

**Living donor pancreas (distal pancreas):**
- Emerging; limited centers perform
- Distal pancreas removed; proximal remnant left in donor
- Donor risks: Pancreatitis, endocrine dysfunction
- Recipient benefits: Planned surgery, better HLA match possible
- Still rare; insufficient long-term data

**Re-transplantation (pancreas):**
- Possible if first graft fails
- Second graft outcomes worse than first (sensitization, prior surgery)
- Usually reserved for motivated candidates

**Xenotransplantation (pancreas):**
- Genetically modified pig pancreas research ongoing
- Potential future option if animal organ can reliably function
- FDA approval of pig heart (2023) suggests FDA openness
- Still experimental; no clinical pancreas xenotransplants yet

**Immunological tolerance strategies:**
- Induction of tolerance to pancreas could eliminate need for lifelong IS
- Chimerism (mixed immune system) being explored
- Could revolutionize outcomes if successful
