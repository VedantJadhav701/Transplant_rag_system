# DOCUMENT 11: KIDNEY TRANSPLANT - INDICATIONS, CONTRAINDICATIONS, AND RECIPIENT EVALUATION

## Executive Summary

Kidney transplantation offers superior survival and quality-of-life outcomes compared to chronic dialysis for the majority of patients with end-stage kidney disease. Comprehensive recipient evaluation is critical to identify suitable candidates, assess and mitigate medical risks, and ensure informed consent. This document addresses indications for kidney transplantation, absolute and relative contraindications with contemporary interpretation, and the comprehensive pre-transplant evaluation including cardiovascular assessment, malignancy screening, infectious disease workup, immunologic assessment, and psychosocial evaluation.

## 1. INDICATIONS FOR KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION

### 1.1 General Indication: End-Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD)

**Definition:** Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <15 mL/min/1.73m² or requirement for renal replacement therapy

**Benefits of transplantation vs. dialysis:**

| Outcome | Transplant | Dialysis | Difference |
|---------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Median survival** | 12-20 years | 4-5 years | 8-15 years longer |
| **Cardiovascular mortality** | Lower | Higher (>50% of deaths) | Significantly reduced |
| **Infection rate** | Lower | Higher | Transplant safer |
| **Quality of life** | Excellent | Restricted | Superior |
| **Employment rate** | 40-50% | 10-15% | Much higher |
| **Cost per life-year** | Lower | Higher | Transplant cost-effective |
| **Hospitalizations** | Fewer | More frequent | Fewer with transplant |
| **Dietary restrictions** | Minimal | Significant | Much more freedom |

**Survival benefit:**
- Transplant recipient: 15-year median survival ~60% (KDIGO data)
- Dialysis patient: 15-year survival ~20%
- Relative mortality reduction: ~70% with transplant (adjusted for age, comorbidities)

### 1.2 ESKD Etiologies (Common)

| Cause | % of ESKD | Clinical Notes |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| **Diabetes** | 35-40% | Type 1 and 2; transplant standard therapy |
| **Hypertension** | 25-30% | Often multifactorial with glomerulonephritis |
| **Glomerulonephritis** | 10-15% | IgA, FSGS, MPGN, ANCA-associated, anti-GBM |
| **Polycystic kidney disease** | 5-7% | Autosomal dominant; hereditary |
| **Interstitial nephritis** | 3-5% | Drug-induced, pyelonephritis, obstruction |
| **Lupus nephritis** | 1-2% | SLE-associated |
| **Other (vascular, hereditary, unknown)** | 5-10% | Renovascular disease, thin BM, Alport, others |

### 1.3 Timing of Transplant Evaluation

**Early evaluation recommended:**
- **eGFR <20 mL/min/1.73m²:** Begin evaluation; candidate may not yet need dialysis
- **eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73m²:** Full evaluation and listing if suitable
- **Preemptive transplant:** Transplant before dialysis start (living donor); superior outcomes (1-3 year graft survival advantage)

**Barriers to preemptive transplant:**
- Patient/family awareness (many not educated about option)
- Lack of identified living donor
- Medical contraindications discovered during evaluation
- Evaluation time delays

## 2. CONTRAINDICATIONS TO KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION

### 2.1 Absolute Contraindications (Transplant Not Performed)

**Active, untreated malignancy:**
- Ongoing malignancy not controlled by active therapy
- Exception: Basalioma, non-melanoma skin cancer (can transplant with surveillance)
- Rationale: Immunosuppression accelerates cancer progression; worse outcomes with active disease

**Uncontrolled life-threatening infection:**
- Active sepsis, osteomyelitis with bacteremia, active endocarditis, active tuberculosis
- Rationale: Immunosuppression worsens infection; untreated disease incompatible with surgery
- Resolution: Treat infection; re-evaluate when controlled

**Inability to adhere to medication regimen (severe, documented):**
- Demonstrated pattern of medication non-adherence with serious consequences (transplant failure, rejection)
- Rationale: Non-adherence to immunosuppression guarantees graft failure
- Assessment: Psychosocial evaluation identifies barriers; education, support systems may improve adherence

**Uncontrolled active substance abuse (heroin, cocaine, alcohol):**
- Current active use; not distant past history
- Rationale: Impairs adherence, immune function, medical judgment
- Exception: Stable recovery/sobriety can make transplant appropriate; individualize assessment

**Severe psychiatric illness with active suicidality or homicidality:**
- Uncontrolled bipolar disorder, major depression with suicidal ideation, psychosis
- Rationale: Safety concern; risk of harm to self or others incompatible with transplant (surgical risk, medication management)
- Note: Psychiatric illness itself not contraindication if stable and treated

**Severe untreated/uncontrollable cardiovascular disease:**
- Acute coronary syndrome, uncontrolled arrhythmia, acute decompensated heart failure (NYHA IV)
- Rationale: Surgical risk too high
- Note: Controlled cardiovascular disease not contraindication; may require optimization first

---

### 2.2 Relative Contraindications (Considered; May Transplant with Discussion/Modification)

**Advanced age:**
- No absolute age cutoff; some transplant recipients 75-80+ years old
- Risk factors: Frailty, comorbidities, reduced life expectancy
- Assessment: Functional status, physiologic age (not chronologic), predicted life-years benefit
- Management: Careful donor selection (lower KDPI organs), enhanced monitoring

**Significant obesity (BMI >40):**
- Surgical complications: Wound infection, delayed healing, graft compression
- Metabolic complications: Diabetes, dyslipidemia
- Management: Preoperative weight loss program; bariatric surgery if needed; careful donor matching

**Severe peripheral vascular disease:**
- Affects surgical approach (iliac vessels may be diseased)
- Risk: Vascular complications, graft thrombosis
- Assessment: Angiography if significant disease
- Management: Surgical approach modification; vascular intervention if needed

**Severe coronary artery disease (CAD):**
- Relative contraindication; absolute contraindication only if uncontrollable/unstable
- Risk: Perioperative MI
- Assessment: Stress test or coronary angiography if suspected high risk
- Management: Optimization (medical therapy, revascularization if indicated); timing of transplant

**Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD):**
- Surgical anesthesia risk
- Assessment: Pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas
- Management: Optimization; timing consideration

**Moderate-to-severe chronic liver disease:**
- Affects metabolic drug handling, infection risk, coagulopathy
- Assessment: INR, albumin, ultrasound for cirrhosis
- Management: Liver biopsy if unclear; combined liver-kidney transplant if cirrhotic

**Hepatitis B or C infection:**
- Historically contraindication; now manageable
- HBV: Antiviral prophylaxis (tenofovir, lamivudine)
- HCV: Direct-acting antivirals can cure infection; transplant after cure or during immunosuppression
- Management: Infectious disease consultation; baseline liver assessment

**HIV infection:**
- Formerly absolute contraindication; now relative
- Current: HIV+ recipients can receive HIV+ organs or negative organs with suppressed CD4 >200 cells/μL
- Management: Infectious disease consultation; ensure undetectable viral load; antiretroviral therapy

**Severe psychiatric illness (stable on treatment):**
- Psychiatric diagnosis itself not contraindication; stability essential
- Assessment: Psychiatric evaluation; ensure medication adherence
- Management: Continue psychiatric care; transplant center coordination

**Previous non-compliance with medical care:**
- Not absolute if patient demonstrates insight and improved adherence
- Assessment: Detailed history; understanding of need for compliance
- Management: Education, support systems, frequent monitoring

**Undiagnosed or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus:**
- HbA1c >8-9% → increased surgical complications, infections
- Management: Glycemic control optimization pre-transplant

## 3. COMPREHENSIVE PRE-TRANSPLANT EVALUATION

### 3.1 Cardiovascular Evaluation

**Risk stratification:**
- Low risk: Age <50, no cardiac symptoms, no risk factors
- Intermediate risk: Age 50-70, or cardiac risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, prior MI/angina, abnormal ECG)
- High risk: Age >70, multiple risk factors, prior cardiac events, heart failure

**Evaluation components:**

| Risk Level | Evaluation |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Low** | History, physical exam, ECG, baseline troponin |
| **Intermediate** | Above + stress test (exercise or pharmacologic) or coronary CTA |
| **High** | Above + coronary angiography (if stress test abnormal or high suspicion) |
| **Very high (prior CAD)** | Coronary angiography |

**Specific tests:**
- **ECG:** Baseline rhythm, ischemic changes, prior MI pattern, LVH
- **Troponin:** Baseline; elevated troponin → high-risk (coronary angiography)
- **Echocardiography:** LVEF, diastolic function, valvular disease, regional wall motion abnormality
- **Stress testing:**
  - Treadmill (if mobile, normal baseline ECG)
  - Pharmacologic (dobutamine, adenosine, regadenoson) if unable to exercise
  - Sensitivity ~85%, specificity ~70% (moderate test)
  
- **Coronary CTA:** Non-invasive coronary imaging; increasingly used (sensitivity >95%)
- **Coronary angiography:** Gold standard; invasive; reserved for high-risk or if stress test abnormal

**Management if CAD found:**
- Medical optimization: Aspirin, beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, statin
- Revascularization: PCI or CABG if significant stenosis
- Timing: Delay transplant 2-4 weeks post-revascularization if possible (healing)

---

### 3.2 Malignancy Screening

**Principles:**
- Screen for current malignancy (contraindication)
- Assess cancer risk (modified IS may be recommended)
- Establish baseline (post-transplant surveillance context)

**Screening by age and sex:**

| Screening | Frequency | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Colon (age 45-75)** | Every 10 years (colonoscopy) or 5 years (sigmoidoscopy) | Earlier/more frequent if high-risk |
| **Breast (age 40-74)** | Annual mammography or MRI if high-risk | Clinical breast exam annually |
| **Cervix (age 21-65)** | Every 3 years (Pap) or every 5 years (HPV) | Earlier start if immunocompromised |
| **Prostate (age 50+)** | Individualized (shared decision-making); PSA ± DRE | Earlier if family history, African American |
| **Skin** | Dermatology exam (full-body); annual thereafter | Pre-transplant baseline |
| **Lung (high-risk smokers)** | Low-dose CT if 50-80 years, 20 pack-year history | Screen annually if abnormal |
| **Liver ultrasound (HCV/HBV+)** | Every 6 months | If cirrhosis risk |

**Cancer-free waiting intervals** (not absolute; individualized):
- Melanoma: 2-5 years
- Other solid tumors: 2-3 years
- Breast: 2-5 years
- Basal cell carcinoma, in situ cervical cancer: Transplant after excision

### 3.3 Infectious Disease Evaluation

**Serologies at baseline:**

| Test | Indication | Action if Positive |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **HIV** | Universal screening | Relative contraindication (can transplant if undetectable and CD4 >200) |
| **HBsAg (HBV)** | Universal | Document; antiviral prophylaxis if considering HBV+ donor |
| **Anti-HBc, anti-HBs** | Universal | Assess immunity; vaccination if negative |
| **Anti-HCV (HCV)** | Universal | Confirm with RNA; can transplant; DAA therapy post-TX if needed |
| **CMV serology** | Universal | D+R− designation (high prophylaxis/monitoring) |
| **EBV serology** | Universal | EBV-negative recipients flagged for enhanced PTLD monitoring |
| **RPR/TPPA (syphilis)** | Universal | Treat if positive; neurosyphilis screening if symptomatic |
| **Strongyloides serology** | Universal or endemic areas | Treat before transplant if positive (ivermectin) |
| **TB (IGRA or TST)** | Universal | If positive, rule out active TB; treat LTBI if positive |
| **Toxoplasma serology** | Consider (varies by region) | If positive, TMP-SMX prophylaxis post-TX covers |
| **Hepatitis A serology** | Consider | If negative, vaccinate pre-TX |

**Active infection assessment:**
- Blood cultures if febrile or septic
- Urinalysis/culture (assess for UTI; treat if positive)
- Chest X-ray (assess for pulmonary infection, TB)
- Assessment for opportunistic infections (PCP prophylaxis covers risk)

**Latent infection management:**
- LTBI (positive IGRA/TST): Treat before transplant (INH × 9 months or RIPE × 4 months) to prevent TB reactivation post-transplant
- Strongyloides: Treat before transplant (ivermectin × 2 doses) to prevent hyperinfection

---

### 3.4 Immunologic Evaluation

**ABO blood type:** Required for compatibility

**HLA typing:** 
- HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, -DQ, -DP (6 loci initially; extended panel for matching)
- Determines compatibility with donor

**Panel reactive antibody (PRA):**
- Older test; measures % of donor HLA types patient would react to
- Replaced by calculated Panel Reactive Antibody (cPRA) in most centers

**Calculated Panel Reactive Antibody (cPRA):**
- More accurate estimate of sensitization
- cPRA 0%: No sensitization (easy to match)
- cPRA 1-50%: Mild sensitization
- cPRA 51-97%: Moderate-to-high sensitization
- cPRA >97%: Highly sensitized (very difficult to match; priority allocation)

**Donor-specific antibodies (DSA):**
- Anti-HLA antibodies directed against specific donor HLA types
- Assessed via single-antigen bead (SAB) testing
- **Positive DSA:** Contraindication to transplant (donor-specific); high rejection risk
- **Negative DSA:** Compatible (desensitization may be considered if patient had prior sensitization)

**Crossmatch testing (complement-dependent cytotoxicity or flow cytometry):**
- Functional test of donor-specific reactivity
- Positive: Contraindication (hyperacute rejection risk)
- Increasingly replaced by virtual crossmatch (HLA/DSA testing) in low-risk populations

### 3.5 Immunosuppression-Related Assessments

**Renal function:**
- Baseline eGFR (often <15; expected for ESKD)
- Assess for dual kidney transplant need (very small native kidneys, donors >65 years)

**Bone health:**
- DEXA scan assessment of osteoporosis (chronic kidney disease → bone loss)
- Assess need for bone-protective therapy (vitamin D, calcium)

**Metabolic factors:**
- Blood glucose (screen for diabetes)
- Lipid panel (assess dyslipidemia; may require statin)
- Nutrition status (albumin, prealbumin; poor nutrition worsens outcomes)

---

### 3.6 Psychosocial Evaluation

**Components:**

| Area | Assessment |
|------|-----------|
| **Psychiatric history** | Prior/current mental illness; treatment adherence; suicidality risk |
| **Substance abuse** | Alcohol, tobacco, illicit drugs; recovery status if history |
| **Adherence** | Prior medication adherence; healthcare engagement |
| **Support system** | Family, social support; caregiver identified |
| **Social factors** | Housing stability, employment, financial resources |
| **Health literacy** | Understanding of transplant, IS requirements, rejection signs |
| **Motivation** | Understanding reasons for transplant; realistic expectations |
| **Coping skills** | Ability to handle stress, problem-solve, access resources |

**Red flags:**
- Active substance abuse
- Untreated psychiatric illness with poor insight
- Severe social isolation
- Demonstrated non-adherence to prior treatments
- Unrealistic expectations (expecting "cure")

**Management:**
- Clear communication of expectations
- Treatment of modifiable barriers (depression, substance abuse)
- Identification of support systems
- Education about IS requirements
- Frequent follow-up in early post-transplant phase

## 4. SPECIAL POPULATIONS

### 4.1 Elderly Recipients (Age >70 years)

**Considerations:**
- Increased surgical risk (comorbidities)
- Shorter life expectancy (graft survival still beneficial but measured in years, not decades)
- Frailty assessment important
- Medication interactions

**Approach:**
- Physiologic rather than chronologic age assessment
- Lower KDPI organs often appropriate (extended preservation time less issue if recipient not living 20+ years)
- Careful donor selection (ECD organs in some cases)
- Enhanced post-transplant monitoring

---

### 4.2 Diabetic Recipients

**Challenges:**
- Multiple comorbidities (cardiovascular, infections)
- Slower graft function recovery
- Higher infection risk

**Approach:**
- Tight glycemic control pre-transplant (target HbA1c <7.5%)
- Cardiovascular optimization
- Consider pancreas co-transplant if Type 1 DM (eliminates need for insulin; improves graft outcomes in select cases)
- Monitor for PTDM (post-transplant diabetes mellitus from IS)

---

### 4.3 Repeat Transplant Recipients (Second+ Transplant)

**Challenges:**
- Often highly sensitized (prior graft immunization)
- Higher rejection risk
- Risk of sensitization recurrence with second graft

**Approach:**
- Extensive HLA matching or desensitization
- Close DSA monitoring
- Consideration of induction therapy
- Living donation preferred if available

---

### 4.4 Pediatric Recipients

**Special considerations:**
- Growth impact of IS (corticosteroids suppress growth; weigh against transplant benefits)
- Adherence challenges (adolescence)
- School/social integration
- Transition to adult nephrology/transplantation care at 18-21 years
