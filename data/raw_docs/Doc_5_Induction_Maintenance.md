# DOCUMENT 5: INDUCTION AND MAINTENANCE IMMUNOSUPPRESSION PROTOCOLS

## Executive Summary

Effective immunosuppression requires strategic planning incorporating induction therapy (immediate post-operative period) and maintenance regimens (long-term suppression). Induction aims to prevent acute rejection in the highest-risk period (days 1-14 post-transplant) through lymphocyte depletion or costimulation blockade. Maintenance therapy balances immunosuppression intensity (preventing rejection and alloimmunization) against drug toxicity (nephrotoxicity, infection, malignancy) over the recipient's lifetime. Modern protocols are individualized based on immunologic risk, organ type, renal function, and infection risk. This document synthesizes evidence-based induction strategies and maintenance regimen selection across solid organ transplantation.

## 1. PRINCIPLES OF IMMUNOSUPPRESSION SELECTION

### 1.1 Factors Influencing Regimen Choice

**Immunologic Risk Factors:**
- **Low risk:** First transplant, living donor, HLA-matched, no prior sensitization (PRA 0%), no DSA
- **Moderate risk:** First deceased donor transplant, some HLA mismatch, low PRA (<20%), no DSA
- **High risk:** HLA mismatch (3-4+ antigen mismatches), high PRA (>50%), pre-existing DSA, prior transplant, African American race

**Organ-Specific Factors:**
- **Kidney:** Most liberal use of immunosuppression (can tolerate CMV prophylaxis, etc.)
- **Liver:** Relative immunologic privilege; lower immunosuppression often sufficient
- **Heart/Lung:** High rejection risk; require intensive immunosuppression
- **Pancreas:** Similar to kidney; intermediate risk
- **Intestine:** Highest rejection risk; most intensive immunosuppression

**Recipient-Specific Factors:**
- **Renal function:** GFR < 30 mL/min → avoid CNI, consider CNI-sparing
- **Age:** Older recipients may tolerate less intense IS; may need adjusted dosing
- **Comorbidities:** Diabetes, hypertension, CVD influence drug choice
- **Adherence:** High-risk non-adherent recipients → simpler regimens (once-daily dosing preferred)
- **Infection history:** CMV seropositivity, prior BK virus, tuberculosis exposure → specific monitoring/prophylaxis

**Donor Factors:**
- **Extended criteria donor (ECD):** Older donor, prolonged cold ischemia → may warrant more intensive IS
- **Living donor:** Planned surgery; more elective; potential for preoperative conditioning
- **Deceased donor:** Unpredictable cold ischemia; may warrant more aggressive induction

### 1.2 Goals of Immunosuppression

1. **Prevent acute rejection** (target: <20% incidence; modern protocols achieve <10%)
2. **Prevent de novo DSA formation** (target: <25% at 5 years; many programs achieve <15%)
3. **Minimize chronic rejection** (target: Half-life >15 years for modern recipients)
4. **Limit toxicity:**
   - Infection (target: CMV disease <2%; BK disease <5%)
   - PTLD (target: <2%)
   - Renal dysfunction (target: stable creatinine with CNI-minimization strategies)
   - Metabolic complications (target: PTDM incidence <20%)
   - Malignancy (target: de novo cancer <3% at 5 years)

## 2. INDUCTION IMMUNOSUPPRESSION

### 2.1 Purpose and Timing

**Rationale:**
- Immediate post-operative period is highest-risk phase (days 1-14)
- Donor APCs present in graft migrate to secondary lymphoid organs
- Direct allorecognition pathway very active
- Acute rejection risk without induction: 40-50%+
- Induction reduces acute rejection risk 50-75%

**Timing:**
- Ideally started pre-operatively or intraoperatively (before graft reperfusion)
- Can be started on day 0-1 post-operative
- Duration: Single dose (basiliximab, alemtuzumab) to 14 days (rATG)

### 2.2 Depleting Induction Agents

#### Rabbit Anti-Thymocyte Globulin (rATG)

**Mechanism:** Polyclonal antiserum causing T-lymphocyte depletion (apoptosis, CDC, ADCC)

**Dosing Protocols:**

**Protocol A: Standard 7-10 day course (most common)**
- Dose: 1.25 mg/kg IV daily × 7-10 days
- Timing: Start day 0-1 post-operative
- Target: Achieve T-cell depletion (CD4+ <50/μL, CD8+ <50/μL) by day 3-5

**Protocol B: Extended 14-day course (high-risk)**
- Dose: 1.25 mg/kg IV daily × 14 days
- Indication: Highest-risk recipients (sensitized, high HLA mismatch)
- Goal: More profound/sustained depletion

**Protocol C: Shorter 3-5 day course (lower-risk)**
- Dose: 1.25 mg/kg IV daily × 3-5 days
- Indication: Low-risk, living donor, living related donor
- Goal: Adequate T-cell depletion with less toxicity

**Monitoring during rATG:**
- CD4+/CD8+ counts: Track daily or every other day; target <100/μL
- CBC: Platelet count, WBC (may develop thrombocytopenia, neutropenia)
- Viral: CMV antigen; EBV PCR at baseline

**Efficacy:**
- Reduces acute rejection: 5-8% with rATG vs. 20-30% without
- Reduces dnDSA: Some benefit vs. non-depleting induction
- Reduces chronic rejection: Possible benefit (long-term data limited)

**Adverse Effects Management:**

| Adverse Effect | Prevention/Management |
|---|---|
| **Infusion reactions** | Premedicate with acetaminophen 650-1000 mg, diphenhydramine 25-50 mg, IV methylprednisolone 125 mg before dose |
| **Fever/chills** | Anti-fever agents; slower infusion rate |
| **Thrombocytopenia** | Monitor CBC; platelet transfusions if <20,000 |
| **Neutropenia** | Monitor CBC; reduce dose or defer if ANC <1,000 |
| **Serum sickness** (day 10-14) | NSAIDs, antihistamines, additional corticosteroids |
| **PTLD risk** | EBV monitoring; consider shorter course in EBV-negative recipients |

#### Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H)

**Mechanism:** Humanized monoclonal antibody against CD52; lymphocyte depletion

**Dosing:**
- **Single-dose protocol:** 0.3-0.5 mg/kg IV on day 0-1 (total 20-30 mg for adult)
- **Two-dose protocol:** 0.3 mg/kg on day 0, repeated day 4 (total 40-60 mg)
- **Extended protocol:** Less common; 20 mg IV × 5 days

**Advantages:**
- Faster infusion (1-2 hours vs. 4-6 hours for rATG)
- Fewer infusion reactions (humanized)
- Outpatient feasible
- Rapid T-cell depletion

**Disadvantages:**
- Profound B-cell depletion (may be disadvantage)
- More sustained lymphopenia
- Cost (more expensive than rATG)
- Faster T-cell recovery (may increase later rejection risk in some studies)

**Efficacy:** Comparable to rATG; acute rejection prevention similar

---

### 2.3 Non-Depleting Induction Agents

#### Basiliximab (Simulect)

**Mechanism:** Chimeric antibody against IL-2 receptor (CD25); blocks IL-2 signaling without T-cell depletion

**Dosing:**
- **Adult:** 20 mg IV on day 0, day 4 (or day 1, day 5)
- **Pediatric <35 kg:** 10 mg per dose

**Administration:**
- IV bolus or infusion over 20-30 minutes
- Well tolerated; minimal premedication needed

**Advantages:**
- Well tolerated; minimal infusion reactions
- No systemic lymphopenia (T cells inactive but present)
- No increased PTLD risk
- Better for recipients with infection concerns
- Can safely give to EBV-negative recipients

**Disadvantages:**
- **Less potent:** 10-15% acute rejection (vs. 5-8% with depleting agents)
- Limited effect on chronic rejection
- Limited impact on dnDSA prevention
- Cost (expensive)

**Clinical Use:**
- Standard induction in many low-risk, living-donor programs
- Preferred in recipients with chronic infections, immunodeficiency concerns
- Less suitable for high-HLA mismatch, sensitized recipients

**Efficacy:**
- Reduces acute rejection from 40%+ to 10-15%
- Better safety profile than depleting agents
- Trade-off: Less acute rejection prevention

## 3. MAINTENANCE IMMUNOSUPPRESSION

### 3.1 Standard Triple-Drug Regimen

The modern standard maintenance regimen combines three drug classes targeting different immune pathways:

#### Component 1: Calcineurin Inhibitor (CNI)

**Choice between tacrolimus and cyclosporine:**

| Characteristic | Tacrolimus | Cyclosporine |
|---|---|---|
| **Potency** | More potent | Less potent |
| **Dose** | Lower | Higher |
| **Oral bioavailability** | 7-20% | 20-50% |
| **Predictability** | More predictable | Highly variable |
| **Nephrotoxicity** | Similar | Similar |
| **Hypertension** | Moderate | Severe (50-80%) |
| **Gingival hyperplasia** | Rare | Common (20-50%) |
| **Hirsutism** | Rare | Common |
| **PTDM** | 15-25% (high) | 5-10% |
| **Drug interactions** | Moderate (CYP3A4) | Many (CYP3A4, others) |
| **Cost** | Cheaper (generic) | More expensive |
| **Current use** | Standard (90%+) | Declining (5-10%) |

**Tacrolimus dosing and targeting:**

| Time Post-Tx | Initial Dose | Target Trough | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Day 0-3** | 0.1-0.15 mg/kg BID | 10-15 ng/mL | Intense IS; high rejection risk |
| **Week 1-4** | Adjusted per TDM | 10-12 ng/mL | Maintain potency; risk balancing |
| **Month 2-6** | Adjusted per TDM | 8-10 ng/mL | Lower doses as rejection risk declines |
| **Month 6-12** | Adjusted per TDM | 5-8 ng/mL | Maintenance; minimize toxicity |
| **Year 2+** | Adjusted per TDM | 4-6 ng/mL (kidney); 8-10 ng/mL (other organs) | Long-term; focus on minimizing CNI toxicity |

**Therapeutic drug monitoring:**
- Measure **trough level** (C0; just before next dose)
- Timing: Assess 3-5 days after dose change (steady state)
- Frequency: Daily × 3-5 days post-transplant, then every 2-3 days × 2 weeks, weekly × 1 month, then every 1-2 weeks × 3 months, then monthly
- Method: HPLC, LC-MS/MS, or immunoassay (results may differ between methods)

#### Component 2: Antimetabolite

**Choice between Mycophenolic Acid (MPA) and Azathioprine (AZA):**

| Characteristic | MPA (MMF/EC-MPA) | Azathioprine |
|---|---|---|
| **Potency** | More potent | Less potent |
| **Efficacy** | Better outcomes vs. AZA | Inferior outcomes |
| **GI toxicity** | Common (15-30%) | Similar (20-30%) |
| **Bone marrow suppression** | Less | More |
| **Cost** | Expensive | Cheap |
| **Teratogenicity** | Category X (absolute contraindication pregnancy) | Category B (relatively safe in pregnancy) |
| **Current use** | Standard (>90%) | Declining |

**MPA dosing:**

| Agent | Dose | BID vs. QID |
|---|---|---|
| **Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)** | 500-1500 mg BID (1-3 g/day) | BID (or QID if better tolerated) |
| **Enteric-coated MPA (EC-MPA, Myfortic)** | 360-720 mg BID | BID |

**Dosing modifications:**
- Start: 1 g (500 mg MMF) or 720 mg (EC-MPA) BID post-transplant
- Escalate: Increase to 1.5 g BID (1500 mg MMF) or higher as tolerated
- Target: Maximum tolerated dose (usually 1-1.5 g BID) associated with better outcomes
- Reduce: If GI toxicity; attempt dose reduction before discontinuation

**Monitoring:**
- No established therapeutic level monitoring (TDM)
- Clinical response: Rejection prevention, graft function
- CBC: Monitor for neutropenia (target ANC >2,000/μL; discontinue if <1,000)
- LFTs: Baseline

#### Component 3: Corticosteroid

**Dosing and taper:**

| Period | Drug/Dose | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Operative** | Methylprednisolone 500-1000 mg IV × 1 dose | Perioperative anti-inflammatory |
| **POD#1-3** | Methylprednisolone 500-1000 mg IV daily × 3 days | Induction effect |
| **Week 1** | Prednisolone 40-60 mg daily | Transition to PO; high IS |
| **Week 2-4** | Prednisolone: Taper 40→30→20→10 mg daily | Gradual reduction |
| **Month 1-6** | Prednisolone 7.5-10 mg daily | Maintenance |
| **Month 6+** | Prednisolone 5-7.5 mg daily (or discontinue) | Long-term maintenance or withdrawal |

**Steroid minimization vs. withdrawal:**
- **Minimization:** Taper to lowest effective dose (2.5-7.5 mg daily)
  - Safer than withdrawal
  - Reduces adverse effects
  - Required additional IS
  
- **Withdrawal:** Complete discontinuation after weeks-months
  - Suitable for low-risk recipients only
  - Requires excellent other IS
  - Higher acute rejection risk
  - Not recommended: High HLA mismatch, DSA, African American, prior rejection

### 3.2 Maintenance Regimen Strategies by Immunologic Risk

#### Low-Risk Recipient (Living-Related Donor, HLA-Identical)

| Drug | Dose | Comments |
|---|---|---|
| Tacrolimus | Target trough 4-6 ng/mL | Minimal dosing; lower toxicity |
| MPA (MMF) | 500-750 mg BID | Lower doses tolerated |
| Prednisolone | 2.5-5 mg daily | Minimal steroid exposure |

**Induction:** Basiliximab (low rejection risk acceptable)

**Outcome:** Excellent graft survival (>20 years); minimal complications

#### Moderate-Risk Recipient (Deceased Donor, Some HLA Mismatch, No Prior Sensitization)

| Drug | Dose | Comments |
|---|---|---|
| Tacrolimus | Target trough 6-8 ng/mL | Standard dosing |
| MPA (MMF) | 1-1.5 g BID | Standard dose |
| Prednisolone | 5-7.5 mg daily | Maintenance dose |

**Induction:** Basiliximab or short-course rATG × 3-5 days

**Outcome:** Good graft survival (15-18 years); acceptable complications

#### High-Risk Recipient (HLA Mismatch, Prior Sensitization, PRA >50%)

| Drug | Dose | Comments |
|---|---|---|
| Tacrolimus | Target trough 10-12 ng/mL (higher initially) | Increased potency needed |
| MPA (MMF) | 1.5 g BID | Maximum dose |
| Prednisolone | 7.5-10 mg daily | Higher maintenance dose |
| Consider adding: | - | - |
| mTOR inhibitor | Sirolimus 2-5 mg daily OR Everolimus 1-2 mg BID | Additional IS for DSA prevention |

**Induction:** rATG × 10-14 days

**Outcome:** Acceptable graft survival (12-15 years); higher complication risk

---

### 3.3 CNI-Sparing Regimens

Reducing CNI exposure is attractive to minimize nephrotoxicity. Several approaches:

#### Belatacept-Based Regimen

| Component | Dose |
|---|---|
| **Belatacept (costimulation blockade)** | 10 mg/kg IV day 0, day 4, week 2, week 4; then 5 mg/kg monthly |
| **Reduced-dose Tacrolimus** | Target trough 4-6 ng/mL (vs. 8-10 with CNI-based) |
| **MPA** | 1-1.5 g BID |
| **Prednisolone** | 5-7.5 mg daily |

**Advantages:**
- Better renal function preservation
- No hyperglycemia (vs. tacrolimus)
- Less hypertension
- BENEFIT trial: 7-year GFR 48 mL/min (vs. 35 mL/min cyclosporine)

**Disadvantages:**
- IV infusion required (monthly)
- PTLD risk (~2-4% vs. ~1% CNI-based)
- EBV monitoring essential
- Cost

#### mTOR Inhibitor-Based CNI-Sparing Regimen

| Component | Dose |
|---|---|
| **Sirolimus OR Everolimus** | Sirolimus: 2-3 mg daily (target trough 5-8 ng/mL) |
| **Very low-dose Tacrolimus** | Target trough 2-3 ng/mL (minimal CNI) |
| **MPA** | 1-1.5 g BID |
| **Prednisolone** | 5-7.5 mg daily |

**Advantages:**
- Reduced CNI nephrotoxicity
- Anti-proliferative effect
- Anti-fibrotic potential

**Disadvantages:**
- Delayed wound healing (problematic perioperatively)
- Impaired renal recovery (especially with DGF)
- Dyslipidemia
- GI toxicity (diarrhea, stomatitis)
- Requires careful monitoring (target levels)
- Limited long-term data on outcomes

**Timing:** Usually introduced at month 3+ post-transplant (after wound healing, renal recovery)

---

### 3.4 Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) Inhibitor-Based Regimen

#### Early Introduction (3-6 Months Post-Transplant)

**Rationale:**
- In recipients with good renal recovery (creatinine stable)
- Aim to minimize long-term CNI
- Anti-proliferative benefit may reduce vasculopathy

**Regimen:**
- Reduce tacrolimus target from 8-10 ng/mL → 5-6 ng/mL
- Add sirolimus (start 2 mg daily; target trough 5-8 ng/mL)
- Continue MPA 1-1.5 g BID
- Continue prednisolone 5-7.5 mg daily

**Monitoring:**
- TDM for both tacrolimus and sirolimus (levels affect each other via CYP3A4)
- Lipid panel (lipid-lowering therapy often needed)
- CBC (anemia/thrombocytopenia risk)
- Proteinuria (may increase; monitor)

---

## 4. POST-TRANSPLANT IMMUNOSUPPRESSION MANAGEMENT

### 4.1 The First 3 Months (Highest Risk Phase)

**Week 1-2:**
- Close monitoring (TDM twice weekly initially)
- Rapid adjustments based on drug levels
- Monitor for acute rejection
- Infection prophylaxis: CMV (valganciclovir), PCP (TMP-SMX), fungal
- Screen: Baseline DSA, CMV antigen

**Week 2-4:**
- TDM weekly
- Clinical assessments frequent (graft function, proteinuria, vital signs)
- Adjust immunosuppression based on levels and clinical response
- Infection monitoring (CMV antigen weekly)

**Month 1-3:**
- TDM every 2-4 weeks
- Monthly clinic visits
- Assess renal function trajectory
- Screen for comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension)
- Consider escalation if acute rejection develops

### 4.2 Months 3-12 (Stabilization Phase)

**Goals:**
- Stabilize immunosuppression to maintenance levels
- Minimize drug toxicity
- Detect complications early

**Monitoring:**
- TDM: Every 4-8 weeks
- Clinic visits: Monthly × 6, then every 2 months × 6
- Labs: Creatinine, electrolytes, CBC, LFTs monthly
- Viral monitoring: CMV antigen monthly → every 3 months

**Adjustments:**
- Gradually reduce corticosteroids (if not already at maintenance)
- Optimize CNI levels (lower as time increases)
- Assess need for additional agents

**Desensitization/Prevention of dnDSA:**
- For high-risk recipients: Consider additional IVIG doses or agents

### 4.3 Year 1+ (Long-Term Maintenance)

**Goals:**
- Maintain stable graft function
- Prevent dnDSA development
- Prevent chronic rejection
- Minimize medication side effects

**Monitoring:**
- TDM: Every 3-6 months (stable recipients may taper to every 6 months)
- Clinic visits: Every 2-3 months
- Labs: Every 3 months (creatinine, electrolytes, CBC, LFTs)
- Viral monitoring: Every 3-6 months (CMV antigen)
- **DSA testing: Every 6-12 months** (early detection of dnDSA)
- Annual imaging (ultrasound for kidney transplants; annually for first 2 years)

**Long-term adjustments:**
- Further reduction in CNI levels (target 3-5 ng/mL for kidney; higher for other organs)
- Steroid minimization (target 2.5-5 mg daily or discontinuation)
- Consider belatacept conversion (some centers; data limited)
- Address comorbidities aggressively (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes)

---

## 5. EMERGING STRATEGIES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

### 5.1 Tolerance Induction Protocols

**Goal:** Achieve operational tolerance (graft acceptance without immunosuppression)

**Approaches:**
- **Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT):** Establish mixed chimerism
  - Select recipients; non-myeloablative conditioning
  - Limited experience; most data from kidney transplant
  - Complete IS withdrawal achieved in select recipients
  - Risk: GVHD, graft rejection, mortality

- **Thymectomy + induction:** Promote thymic selection of donor-reactive regulatory cells
  - Investigational; limited data
  - Preliminary results promising in some centers

- **Regulatory T-cell (Treg) expansion/infusion:** Enhance natural suppressor cells
  - Phase 2 trials ongoing
  - Goal: Reduce maintenance IS through enhanced Treg function

### 5.2 Biomarker-Driven Immunosuppression

**Emerging approaches:**
- **Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA):** Percent of circulating cfDNA from donor
  - Elevation predicts acute rejection, AMR
  - Can guide IS intensification
  - Commercial assay: AlloSure

- **Gene expression profiling (GEP):** Peripheral blood T-cell gene expression signature
  - Identifies subclinical rejection phenotypes
  - Can guide IS adjustment
  - Commercial assay: TruGraf

- **DSA monitoring:** Serial DSA testing guides therapy
  - dnDSA appearance → IS intensification or plasmapheresis
  - Levels → adjustment of intensity

**Future:** Integration of multiple biomarkers (dd-cfDNA, GEP, DSA, complement activation, etc.) to create personalized IS algorithms

## 6. SUMMARY AND KEY CONCEPTS

1. **Induction immunosuppression** prevents acute rejection in the highest-risk period (days 1-14)
   - Depleting agents (rATG, alemtuzumab): More potent; ~5-8% AR
   - Non-depleting (basiliximab): Less potent; ~10-15% AR; better tolerated

2. **Maintenance regimen** balances IS intensity against toxicity over lifetime
   - Standard triple therapy: CNI (tacrolimus) + antimetabolite (MPA) + corticosteroid
   - Individualized based on immunologic risk, organ type, renal function

3. **Calcineurin inhibitors** remain cornerstone but require therapeutic drug monitoring
   - Tacrolimus preferred (more potent, fewer interactions than cyclosporine)
   - Target levels decrease over time post-transplant

4. **Antimetabolites** required for adequate suppression
   - MPA superior to azathioprine; standard in modern regimens
   - Dose escalation to max tolerated dose associated with better outcomes

5. **Corticosteroids** difficult to withdraw despite toxicity
   - Minimization to 2.5-7.5 mg daily reasonable
   - Complete withdrawal suitable only for low-risk recipients

6. **CNI-sparing approaches** reduce nephrotoxicity
   - Belatacept: Renal-sparing; PTLD concern
   - mTOR inhibitors: Anti-proliferative; impairs renal recovery early

7. **Emerging biomarkers** guide personalized IS adjustments
   - dd-cfDNA, GEP, DSA trends inform therapy
