# DOCUMENT 27: HEART TRANSPLANT - INDICATIONS AND CANDIDATE EVALUATION

## Executive Summary

Heart transplantation is the definitive therapy for end-stage heart failure (ESHF) refractory to medical management and mechanical circulatory support (MCS). Patient selection is critical—candidates must have high likelihood of 5-year survival post-transplant and demonstrate benefit from transplantation. The shortage of donor hearts necessitates careful risk stratification. This document comprehensively addresses indications for heart transplantation, absolute and relative contraindications, candidate evaluation, and contemporary allocation strategies including urgent allocation for mechanical support.

## 1. INDICATIONS FOR HEART TRANSPLANTATION

### 1.1 Primary Indications (Chronic Advanced Heart Failure)

**Candidate criteria (Class 1 recommendations):**

| Criteria | Details | Target |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Peak VO2 <14 mL/kg/min** | Severely limited exercise tolerance | Strongly indicates transplant benefit |
| **NYHA Class III-IV refractory to medical therapy** | Maximal medical management failed | Intractable symptoms |
| **Inotrope-dependent** | Requires continuous IV inotropes | Very limited prognosis without transplant |
| **LVEF <20%** | Severe systolic dysfunction | Criterion for consideration |
| **Recurrent hospitalizations for CHF** | Multiple admissions despite optimization | Quality of life severely impaired |

**Etiology breakdown (% of transplants):**

| Etiology | % | Notes |
|----------|---|-------|
| **Ischemic cardiomyopathy** | 35-40% | CAD with LVEF <20%; prior MI |
| **Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)** | 35-40% | Non-ischemic; genetic or viral |
| **Restrictive cardiomyopathy** | 5-10% | Amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, infiltrative |
| **Valvular disease** | 5-10% | Severe VHD unsuitable for repair |
| **Congenital heart disease** | 2-5% | Complex lesions; Eisenmenger syndrome |
| **Retransplantation** | 5-10% | Chronic rejection; recurrent disease |
| **Other (myocarditis, peripartum, others)** | 5-10% | Diverse etiologies |

### 1.2 Acute/Fulminant Indications

**Cardiogenic shock refractory to medical therapy:**
- Acute myocarditis (fulminant presentation)
- Acute coronary syndrome with extensive infarction
- Peripartum cardiomyopathy (severe; refractory)
- Status post cardiac arrest with severe anoxic injury
- Bridge to transplant with MCS (Status 1A priority)

**Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) as bridge:**
- **Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP):** Short-term support; temporary
- **Ventricular assist device (VAD):** Implantable; medium-long term support
  - **LVAD:** Left ventricular support (most common)
  - **BiVAD:** Biventricular support (if RV failure)
  - **ECMO:** Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; short-term (days-weeks)

## 2. CONTRAINDICATIONS TO HEART TRANSPLANTATION

### 2.1 Absolute Contraindications

| Contraindication | Rationale | Notes |
|-----------------|----------|-------|
| **Uncontrolled active infection** | Infection worsens with IS; sepsis incompatible | Must treat first; defer transplant |
| **Irreversible severe pulmonary hypertension** | RV failure post-transplant; death | PVR >6-8 mmHg/L; fixed PVR even with inhaled agents |
| **Significant active malignancy** | Metastatic disease; poor transplant outcomes | Full remission 5+ years preferred; type-dependent |
| **Untreated severe psychiatric illness** | Adherence risk; unstable | Must be stable/treated |
| **Active substance abuse** | Non-adherence; recidivism | Recent sobriety/rehabilitation required |
| **Severe irreversible hepatic disease** | Cannot metabolize IS; hepatic encephalopathy | Contraindication |
| **Severe irreversible renal disease** | Calcineurin inhibitor toxicity prohibitive | eGFR <20 problematic unless heart-kidney transplant |
| **Persistent elevated pulmonary vascular resistance despite maximal pharmacotherapy** | RV failure; graft failure | Challenge; borderline eGFR |

---

### 2.2 Relative Contraindications (Individualize)

| Contraindication | Assessment | Management |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Age >65 years (vs. 70+)** | Physiologic age; comorbidities | Often acceptable; outcomes reasonable |
| **Diabetes mellitus (especially if poorly controlled)** | Glycemic control; coronary disease | Achieve good control; not contraindication |
| **Severe obesity (BMI >35-40)** | Surgical complications; IS interactions | Weight loss program; consider individually |
| **Active smoking** | Graft coronary disease; lung disease | Must achieve durable cessation |
| **Severe pulmonary hypertension (PVR 4-6 mmHg/L)** | RV failure risk; may improve with inhaled agents | Trial inhaled vasodilators (nitric oxide, epoprostenol) |
| **Significant CAD in recipient** | Graft atherosclerosis if recipient disease present | Paradoxically may be benefit (transplant is new start) |
| **Prior cardiac surgery** | Increased operative difficulty, time | Not contraindication; technically feasible |
| **Chronic kidney disease (eGFR 30-50)** | CNI toxicity; proteinuria | Monitor closely; individualize |
| **Fixed elevated PVR (despite inhaled agents)** | RV failure post-transplant | Borderline contraindication; some centers try; risky |
| **Hepatic dysfunction (elevated LFTs, mild cirrhosis)** | IS metabolism impairment | Mild elevation acceptable; cirrhosis contraindication |

## 3. CANDIDATE EVALUATION

### 3.1 Cardiac and Hemodynamic Assessment

**Essential testing:**

| Test | Purpose | Findings of Concern |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Transthoracic echocardiography** | Assess LVEF, RV function, valvular disease, PE | LVEF <20%; RV dysfunction |
| **Cardiac catheterization** | Hemodynamics (CO, CI, wedge, PVR) | Elevated filling pressures, low CI, elevated PVR |
| **Right heart catheterization (RHC)** | Measure PVR, transpulmonary gradient | PVR >3-4 mmHg/L concerning |
| **Exercise stress test or CPX** | Peak VO2, exercise tolerance | Peak VO2 <14 mL/kg/min indicates transplant benefit |
| **Coronary angiography** | Rule out significant CAD | Significant CAD = may preclude listing (surgically correctable lesions okay) |
| **Cardiac MRI** | Assess scar, infiltration, viability | Useful if echo indeterminate |

**Hemodynamic parameters of interest:**

- **Cardiac index (CI):** <2.0 L/min/m² = severely depressed
- **Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP):** >20 mmHg = elevated
- **Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR):** <3 mmHg/L = ideal; >5 = concerning; >6-8 = contraindication
- **Transpulmonary gradient (TPG = mPAP - PCWP):** <12 is best; <15 acceptable; >16 concerning

**Reversibility of elevated PVR:**
- Trial inhaled pulmonary vasodilators (nitric oxide 20-40 ppm, epoprostenol)
- If PVR drops significantly → may become candidate
- If fixed → likely contraindication (RV failure risk)

### 3.2 End-Organ Function Assessment

**Renal function:**
- Serum creatinine, eGFR, proteinuria
- eGFR <20 mL/min/1.73m²: High-risk (CNI toxicity); consider heart-kidney transplant
- eGFR 20-50: Monitor closely; acceptable with surveillance
- eGFR >50: Adequate renal reserve

**Hepatic function:**
- AST, ALT, bilirubin, albumin, PT/INR
- Hepatic cirrhosis: Contraindication
- Mild elevation: Often acceptable (hepatic congestion from CHF often resolves post-transplant)

**Pulmonary function:**
- FEV1, FVC, DLCO
- Severe restrictive disease (FVC <50%, DLCO <40%): Concerning
- Pulmonary edema from CHF: Often improves post-transplant
- Smoking-related disease: Contraindication if severe

**Infectious serology:**
- CMV, EBV, HSV, VZV, HIV, HBV, HCV, syphilis, TB

### 3.3 Psychosocial Evaluation

**Components:**
- Psychiatric history, current mental health status
- Substance use (alcohol, drugs); sobriety duration
- Medication adherence history
- Social support system
- Understanding of transplant process
- Motivation for transplant
- Coping skills, stress management
- Financial barriers

**Red flags:**
- Active psychiatric illness (untreated)
- Active substance use
- Poor medication adherence history
- Social isolation
- Financial inability to afford medication/follow-up

## 4. ALLOCATION STRATEGY

### 4.1 Status System (UNOS/OPTN Heart Allocation)

**Status 1A (Highest priority):**
- Inotrope-dependent (despite maximum pharmacotherapy)
- Mechanical circulatory support (LVAD, RVAD, BiVAD, ECMO)
- Mechanical ventilation for cardiopulmonary support
- Temporary circulatory support (IABP)
- Younger recipients with irreversible acute cardiac injury

**Status 1B:**
- Inotrope-dependent (lower doses or shorter duration)
- Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) - bridge to transplant

**Status 2:**
- Inotrope-independent; severe symptoms
- LVEF <20%; peak VO2 <14 mL/kg/min
- High hospitalization rate

**Status 3:**
- New listing (not yet stabilized)
- Chronic stable HF

**Status 4:**
- Inactivated (no longer transplant candidate at present)

### 4.2 Geographic Distribution and Waiting Times

**Organ allocation zones:**
- **Local:** Same region first
- **Regional:** If no local match
- **National:** If no regional match; sickest (1A) has national priority

**Waiting time challenge:**
- Average wait time (non-Status 1A): 6-12 months
- Status 1A: Much shorter (1-2 months average)
- Mortality on waiting list: ~5% annually for Status 2 recipients

## 5. SUMMARY AND KEY CONCEPTS

1. **Indications:** Advanced HF refractory to medical therapy; peak VO2 <14 mL/kg/min ideal
2. **LVEF <20%:** Severe systolic dysfunction; primary indication
3. **Inotrope-dependence:** Strong indication; Status 1A priority
4. **Mechanical support:** Bridge to transplant; improves outcomes vs. medical therapy alone
5. **Pulmonary hypertension:** Major risk factor; must assess reversibility
6. **RV function:** Critical; elevated PVR or RV failure = contraindication
7. **Renal function:** eGFR >30 acceptable; <20 requires heart-kidney consideration
8. **Psychosocial:** Stable, motivated, adequate support required
9. **Status system:** 1A (most urgent) → 2 (stable symptomatic) → 3 (new listing)
10. **LVEF <20% + NYHA III-IV refractory = transplant candidate**
