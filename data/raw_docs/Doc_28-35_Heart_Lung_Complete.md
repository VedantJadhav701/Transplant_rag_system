# DOCUMENTS 28-35: HEART & LUNG TRANSPLANT - PERIOPERATIVE, COMPLICATIONS, AND OUTCOMES

## [DOCUMENT 28: HEART TRANSPLANT - DONOR EVALUATION & PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT]

### Executive Summary
Heart donor quality directly impacts recipient outcomes. Donor age, ischemia time, and donor-recipient size matching critical. Standard criteria hearts from brain-dead donors provide excellent outcomes. DCD hearts (donation after cardiac death) emerging but limited experience. Perioperative management focuses on expert surgical technique, immunosuppression initiation, and early detection of primary graft failure and acute rejection.

### Key Content Areas:
- **Donor evaluation:** Age, hemodynamics, inotrope requirement, cardiac function
- **Echocardiography:** LVEF, wall motion, valvular disease assessment
- **ABO/HLA matching:** Blood type mandatory; HLA matching less critical than kidney
- **Ischemia time:** <4 hours ideal; >6 hours associated with worse outcomes
- **Organ preservation:** Cold crystalloid flush; target <4 hours ischemia
- **Cardioplegia:** Cold crystalloid ± potassium to induce asystole; cardioprotection
- **Surgical technique:** Biatrial vs. bicaval anastomosis (debate about superiority)
- **Reperfusion:** Careful rewarming; assess graft function
- **Early graft assessment:** Systolic/diastolic function, regurgitation, arrhythmias
- **Mechanical support weaning:** Gradual reduction if VAD was bridge

## [DOCUMENT 29: HEART TRANSPLANT - POST-OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT & EARLY COMPLICATIONS]

### Executive Summary
Post-operative heart transplant management focuses on hemodynamic optimization, immunosuppression initiation, and prevention of early complications. Primary graft failure occurs in ~10% and represents most common cause of early death. Acute rejection occurs in 30-40% and can be life-threatening if fulminant. Arrhythmias, right heart failure, and infections are common early complications.

### Key Content Areas:
- **Hemodynamic monitoring:** Pulmonary artery catheter assessment (CVP, PCWP, CI, SVR)
- **Inotropic support:** Dobutamine, milrinone; gradual weaning as graft recovers
- **Fluid management:** Optimize preload for RV function; avoid overload
- **Arrhythmia management:** Atrial fibrillation common (50%); bradycardia (denervation)
- **Primary graft failure (PGF):** 5-15% incidence; high mortality
  - Definition: Severe systolic/diastolic dysfunction within 24 hours
  - Diagnosis: Echocardiography, hemodynamics
  - Risk factors: Prolonged ischemia, older donor, larger ischemia time
  - Management: Mechanical support (IABP, ECMO, VAD); inotropes; retransplantation if severe
  
- **Acute cellular rejection:** 30-40% incidence (peaks week 1-4)
  - Diagnosis: Endomyocardial biopsy (gold standard; serial biopsies routine)
  - Banff grading: 0-3A/3B/4
  - Clinical presentation: May be asymptomatic (found on routine biopsy)
  - Management: Pulse methylprednisolone (500-1000 mg × 3 days); rATG if steroid-resistant
  
- **Acute antibody-mediated rejection:** <5% incidence; more fulminant
  - Diagnosis: Positive C4d staining on biopsy; DSA present
  - Management: Plasmapheresis, IVIG, rituximab
  
- **Infection:** Opportunistic (CMV, PCP, fungal) and bacterial
  - CMV prophylaxis mandatory if D+R− (valganciclovir)
  - PCP prophylaxis (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole)
  - Fungal prophylaxis if high-risk
  
- **Right heart failure:** 10-15% incidence; related to elevated PVR pre-transplant
  - Management: Inhaled nitric oxide, milrinone, mechanical support if needed

- **Pericardial effusion:** Common; usually small; rarely tamponade

## [DOCUMENT 31: LUNG TRANSPLANT - INDICATIONS AND CANDIDATE EVALUATION]

### Executive Summary
Lung transplantation is indicated for end-stage lung disease refractory to medical therapy. Indications include COPD (40%), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (40%), cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, and others. The Lung Allocation Score (LAS) prioritizes candidates with greatest transplant benefit relative to waiting list mortality. This document addresses indications, candidate evaluation, and allocation strategy for lung transplantation.

### Key Content Areas:
- **Primary indications (% of transplants):**
  - COPD: 35-40% (emphysema, alpha-1 AAT deficiency)
  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF): 35-40% (progressive; limited medical options)
  - Cystic fibrosis: 10-15% (progressive; recurrent infections)
  - Pulmonary hypertension: 5-10% (idiopathic, chronic thromboembolic)
  - Other (bronchiectasis, LAM, occupational lung disease): 5-10%

- **Allocation: Lung Allocation Score (LAS)**
  - Replaces waiting time (unlike heart kidneys)
  - Integrates 2 components:
    1. **Transplant benefit score:** Predicted benefit (mortality reduction) from transplant
    2. **Waiting list mortality score:** Risk of death before transplant
  - Higher LAS = higher priority (sickest who benefit most)
  - Reduces mortality on waiting list
  - Controversy: Some lower-LAS candidates may need transplant even if longer survival expected

- **Evaluation components:**
  - **Pulmonary function tests (PFTs):** FEV1, FVC, TLC, DLCO
    - FEV1 <25% predicted (COPD)
    - FVC <50% predicted, DLCO <40% predicted (IPF)
  - **6-minute walk test (6MWT):** Exercise tolerance; desaturation assessment
  - **High-resolution CT (HRCT):** Assess extent of disease, rule out malignancy
  - **Cardiac assessment:** Echocardiography (pulmonary hypertension severity); right heart catheterization
  - **Right heart catheterization:** Measure PA pressures, PVR (PAH diagnosis/severity)
  - **Blood gas:** Hypoxemia/hypercapnia assessment; oxygen requirement
  - **Nutritional status:** BMI; sarcopenia (poor prognosis marker)

- **Contraindications to lung transplant:**
  - Uncontrolled infection (especially if CF + B. cepacia)
  - Significant active malignancy
  - Severe hepatic/renal disease
  - Untreated psychiatric illness
  - Active substance abuse
  - Non-adherence history
  - Severe coronary disease (unsuitable for bypass)
  - BMI >30-32 (relative; increased complications)
  - Absence of social support

## [DOCUMENT 32: LUNG TRANSPLANT - DONOR EVALUATION & PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT]

### Executive Summary
Lung donor quality critical for outcomes. Donor lung injury (acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS], aspiration, infection) common; many marginal organs can be successfully transplanted. Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) enables assessment and recovery of initially poor-quality lungs. Perioperative management emphasizes precise surgical technique, careful reperfusion, and prevention of primary graft dysfunction.

### Key Content Areas:
- **Donor assessment:**
  - Age, smoking history, cause of death
  - Oxygenation: PaO2/FiO2 ratio (>300 = ideal; <200 = concern)
  - Chest X-ray: Infiltrates, aspiration, edema
  - Bronchoscopy: Purulent secretions, aspiration, infection
  - Organ procurement: In situ flush; careful dissection of hilum

- **Lung-specific donor quality:**
  - Extended criteria donors increasingly used (older, lower PaO2/FiO2)
  - Donor risk index calculated; matched with recipient
  - Donor age >60 or PaO2/FiO2 <300: Associated with worse outcomes
  - Marginal organs now often accepted (shortage driving acceptance of higher-risk organs)

- **Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP):** Emerging technology
  - Preserves lungs outside body in perfused state
  - Allows assessment of marginal organs (gas exchange recovery)
  - May improve function vs. cold storage alone
  - Enables longer preservation window (12-18 hours possible)
  - Not yet standard (cost, infrastructure); growing use

- **Surgical technique:**
  - Single-lung vs. bilateral lung transplant (BLT)
  - Bilateral more common now (better long-term outcomes; BOS risk lower)
  - Incision: Bilateral thoracotomy (clamshell) or sequential single-lung incisions
  - CPB (cardiopulmonary bypass): Often used to maintain oxygenation during single-lung clamping
  - Vascular anastomosis: PA, vein, bronchus (three anastomoses each side)
  - Bronchial anastomosis: Single vascular anastomosis (no separate bronchial artery reconstruction)

- **Reperfusion injury prevention:**
  - Gradual reperfusion (low pressure, slow infusion initially)
  - Avoid excessive fluid (risk of pulmonary edema)
  - Inhaled nitric oxide, milrinone to reduce PVR
  - Anesthetic maintenance

## [DOCUMENT 33: LUNG TRANSPLANT - POST-OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT & PRIMARY GRAFT DYSFUNCTION]

### Executive Summary
Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is the most common cause of early morbidity/mortality in lung transplant, occurring in 10-40% of recipients. Characterized by noncardiogenic pulmonary edema in first 72 hours post-transplant. Acute rejection occurs in 40-50% at 1 year. Early complications include infection, hemoptysis, bronchial stricture, and arrhythmias. Careful hemodynamic management and infection prevention critical.

### Key Content Areas:
- **Primary graft dysfunction (PGD):** Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema within first 72 hours
  - Incidence: 10-40% (varies by definition severity grade)
  - Etiology: Ischemia-reperfusion injury; donor lung injury; immune activation
  - Grading: Mild (Grade 1) to Severe (Grade 3)
  - Diagnosis: Chest X-ray (infiltrates); oxygenation criteria (PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300 + radiographic changes)
  - Risk factors: Prolonged ischemia, marginal donor, older donor, higher PVR recipient
  - Management: Mechanical ventilation; inhaled nitric oxide; ECMO if severe
  - Prognosis: Mild PGD usually recovers; severe PGD associated with higher mortality

- **Acute cellular rejection:** 40-50% incidence at 1 year
  - Diagnosis: Transbronchial lung biopsy (less invasive than endomyocardial heart biopsies)
  - Symptoms: Dyspnea, fever, decreased FEV1; often asymptomatic
  - Management: Pulse corticosteroids (500-1000 mg × 3 days); increase CNI level
  - More refractory than heart rejection; may require rATG

- **Bronchial anastomotic complications:**
  - Bronchial stricture: 5-15%; may require endoscopic dilation, stent, or surgical revision
  - Dehiscence: Rare; life-threatening if occurs; early diagnosis critical
  - Presentation: Dyspnea, fever, infiltrate; bronchoscopy shows narrowing

- **Infection (very common; major cause of morbidity/mortality):**
  - Bacterial: Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, others
  - Fungal: Aspergillus (endemic fungi in some regions)
  - CMV: Pneumonitis if D+R− (prophylaxis mandatory)
  - Viral: RSV, influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus
  - Management: Broad-spectrum antibiotics initially; culture-guided therapy; prophylaxis

- **Hemoptysis:** Bleeding from bronchial anastomosis or lung tissue; rarely massive; usually self-limited

## [DOCUMENT 34: LUNG TRANSPLANT - BRONCHIOLITIS OBLITERANS SYNDROME (BOS) & CHRONIC REJECTION]

### Executive Summary
Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is chronic rejection of lung allograft, characterized by progressive small-airway fibrosis leading to airflow obstruction. BOS develops in 40-50% by 5 years and is leading cause of long-term graft failure in lung. Presents as progressive decline in FEV1 over months-years. Management is difficult; limited effective therapies. Early detection and intervention may slow progression.

### Key Content Areas:
- **Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS):** Chronic rejection of lung
  - Incidence: 40-50% by 5 years post-transplant
  - Pathophysiology: Epithelial injury → inflammatory repair → excessive collagen deposition → airway narrowing
  - Clinical presentation: Progressive dyspnea over weeks-months; nonproductive cough
  - FEV1 decline: Key diagnostic feature (>20% decline from baseline FEV1)
  - Diagnosis: Spirometry showing FEV1 decline; HRCT (bronchial wall thickening, bronchiectasis, air trapping)
  - Bronchoscopy/biopsy: Confirmatory (constrictive bronchiolitis pathology)

- **BOS staging:**
  - **BOS 0:** FEV1 80-90% of baseline (at-risk)
  - **BOS 0-p:** FEV1 81-90% with features suggesting early decline
  - **BOS 1:** FEV1 66-80% of baseline
  - **BOS 2:** FEV1 51-65% of baseline
  - **BOS 3:** FEV1 ≤50% of baseline

- **Risk factors for BOS:**
  - Acute rejection episodes (most important modifiable risk)
  - HLA mismatch
  - CMV infection (controversial; some evidence for association)
  - Non-adherence to IS
  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD; silent aspiration)
  - Infection (recurrent lower respiratory)
  
- **Management of BOS (prevention better than treatment):**
  - **Prevention (most effective):**
    - Minimize acute rejection (adequate IS, close monitoring)
    - CMV prophylaxis
    - GERD control (PPI, H2 blocker)
    - Infection prevention
  
  - **Treatment (limited efficacy):**
    - Azithromycin (macrolide immunomodulator; controversial benefit; ~30% may slow)
    - Augmented IS (increase CNI, antimetabolite, add rituximab)
    - Inhaled cyclosporine: Limited evidence
    - Retransplantation: Only option for end-stage BOS; high mortality; median survival ~5 years

- **Prognosis of BOS:**
  - Median survival after BOS diagnosis: 5-7 years
  - Progressive decline in FEV1 (~50 mL/year average)
  - Quality of life deteriorates significantly
  - Retransplantation only curative option (but risky; limited graft availability)
