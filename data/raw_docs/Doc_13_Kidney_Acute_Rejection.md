# DOCUMENT 13: KIDNEY TRANSPLANT - ACUTE REJECTION AND EARLY COMPLICATIONS (DAYS-MONTHS)

## Executive Summary

Acute rejection remains one of the most common complications in the early post-transplant period (days to months), occurring in 10-25% of recipients despite modern immunosuppression. Early recognition and prompt treatment are critical to prevent graft loss. This document comprehensively addresses acute cellular rejection (ACR) and acute antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) specific to kidney transplantation, including epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnostic approaches, and management protocols. Early non-immunologic complications (vascular, urologic, infectious) are also addressed, with emphasis on differential diagnosis and management strategies.

## 1. ACUTE REJECTION IN KIDNEY TRANSPLANT

### 1.1 Epidemiology and Risk Factors

**Incidence:**
- ACR (acute cellular rejection): 10-20% incidence at 1 year (varies by IS regimen, risk stratification)
- AMR (acute antibody-mediated rejection): 2-5% incidence (more common in sensitized recipients)
- ABMR-dominant (antibody-mediated with minimal cell inflammation): Emerging category; increasing recognition

**Risk factors for acute rejection:**

| Risk Factor | Impact | Management |
|---|---|---|
| **Non-adherence to IS** | Highest risk | Patient education, adherence monitoring |
| **DCD kidney** | Increased risk | More intensive IS induction |
| **High KDPI donor** | Increased risk | Careful IS dosing; monitor levels |
| **HLA mismatch** | Increased risk | Allocate better kidneys to less-matched recipients |
| **Pre-existing DSA** | Very high risk | Desensitization; enhanced IS |
| **De novo DSA development** | Indicates ongoing sensitization | IS intensification; plasmapheresis/IVIG |
| **Young recipient age** | Higher immune response | More intensive IS in young recipients |
| **African American race** | Increased risk | Individualized IS strategies |
| **Prior transplant** | Increased risk | Enhanced IS; consider prior outcomes |

### 1.2 Clinical Presentation of Acute Rejection

**Acute cellular rejection (ACR):**
- Asymptomatic: Many ACR episodes detected only on monitoring (rising creatinine)
- Symptomatic presentations:
  - **Rising creatinine:** Most common (may be slow rise or acute; compare baseline trend)
  - **Fever:** May accompany rejection (not specific)
  - **Graft tenderness:** Swelling of allograft; pain over graft site
  - **Oliguria/anuria:** Severe ACR may present with dramatic UOP decline
  - **Hypertension:** ACR-associated inflammatory state increases BP

**Acute antibody-mediated rejection (AMR):**
- Similar presentations to ACR but often more abrupt
- Rising creatinine often more rapid/severe than ACR
- **Acute AMR:** Within days-weeks; more aggressive
- **Late acute AMR:** Weeks-months; often associated with de novo DSA development

**Differential diagnosis (not rejection):**
- Infection (UTI, CMV, other): Fever, elevated WBC, cultural/PCR evidence
- Calcineurin inhibitor toxicity: Rising creatinine but NO rejection on biopsy; reduce CNI level
- Recurrent disease: Rising proteinuria; may have systemic symptoms
- Dehydration: History of poor intake; responds to hydration
- Vascular complication: Sudden anuria; abnormal Doppler ultrasound
- Drug-induced: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) can increase creatinine; NSAIDs cause acute kidney injury

### 1.3 Diagnostic Approach

**Clinical assessment:**
- Timing: When did creatinine start rising? Baseline level? Rate of rise?
- Symptoms: Fever, graft tenderness, oliguria
- Medication adherence: Any missed doses? IS levels subtherapeutic?
- Infection signs: Fever pattern, source (UTI, pneumonia, other)
- Volume status: Euvolemic, overloaded, depleted?

**Laboratory studies:**
- **Serum creatinine:** Baseline and trend; calculate eGFR change
- **BUN:** Often elevated with rejection
- **CBC:** Elevated WBC suggests infection or rejection; normal in CNI toxicity alone
- **Tacrolimus level:** Subtherapeutic level suggests non-adherence
- **Urinalysis:** Pyuria suggests UTI; protein/RBC can indicate rejection

**Imaging:**
- **Renal ultrasound with Doppler:** 
  - Assess perfusion (should be monophasic/biphasic flow in renal artery)
  - Rule out hydronephrosis (obstruction)
  - Measure resistive index (RI >0.8 suggests parenchymal disease; can be seen in rejection)
  - Assess graft size (increased size in early rejection)

**Renal allograft biopsy (gold standard for diagnosis):**
- Indication: Rise in creatinine without clear alternative explanation
- Timing: Perform within days of creatinine rise (before irreversible damage)
- Method: Percutaneous ultrasound-guided needle biopsy (19-18 gauge needle)
- Yield: >90% diagnostic quality if adequate sampling (>10 glomeruli, adequate medullary tissue)
- Risk: Hematoma (5-10%), bleeding (rare), infection (very rare)

**Banff Classification (2017) for acute rejection:**
- See Document 2 for comprehensive Banff coverage
- **ACR grade (0-3):** Based on inflammation severity (tubulitis, intimal arteritis)
  - Grade IA: Mild (i1, t1)
  - Grade IB: Mild (i1, t2-3 OR i2-3, t1)
  - Grade IIA: Moderate (moderate intimal arteritis; v1)
  - Grade IIB: Moderate (severe intimal arteritis; v2-3)
  - Grade III: Severe (arterial transmural inflammation with fibrinoid necrosis; v3)

- **ABMR diagnosis (Banff 2017 criteria):**
  - Morphologic evidence: Microvascular inflammation (glomerulitis score g≥1, ptc≥1)
  - Immunologic evidence: C4d deposition (peritubular capillaries; C4d≥2) AND/OR DSA present
  - Alternative (if C4d negative): DSA present + morphologic evidence + serologic/molecular evidence (increases MFI, complement genes expressed)

## 2. MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE REJECTION

### 2.1 Acute Cellular Rejection (ACR) Treatment

**Mild ACR (Grade I):**
- Some centers observe with close monitoring (risk of progression)
- Most treat with corticosteroid boluses

**Corticosteroid pulse (first-line for ACR):**
- **Methylprednisolone:** 500 mg IV daily × 3 days
- Alternative: IV methylprednisolone 1000 mg × 1-3 days (more intense)
- Monitoring: Creatinine daily during treatment; expect improvement by day 2-3
- Success rate: 70-80% of ACR respond to steroids alone
- Risk: Infection (temporary relative immunosuppression reduction)

**Failure to respond to steroids (by day 3-5):**
- **Rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG):**
  - 1.25 mg/kg IV daily × 7-14 days
  - More effective than steroids for steroid-resistant ACR
  - Requires CMV prophylaxis intensification
  - Success: 80-90% of steroid-resistant ACR respond

- **Alemtuzumab:** 30 mg IV single dose
  - Faster acting than rATG
  - Used in some centers for steroid-resistant rejection
  - Profound lymphocyte depletion; significant PTLD risk

**Concurrent IS adjustments:**
- **Increase CNI level:** Boost tacrolimus to higher target (10-12 ng/mL vs. usual 8 ng/mL maintenance)
- **Optimize antimetabolite:** Ensure adequate MPA dosing (increase to 1-1.5 g BID if not already)
- **Avoid reducing IS:** Tempting to reduce CNI but worsens rejection; increase instead

**Monitoring response:**
- Daily creatinine during active treatment
- Expect creatinine decrease by day 2-3 (even if slow)
- Check biopsy 1 week post-treatment (some centers) to confirm resolution
- TDM for CNI to ensure therapeutic levels maintained

**Outcomes:**
- Steroid-responsive ACR: 80-90% achieve remission; graft function usually recovers near baseline
- Steroid-resistant ACR: 70-80% respond to rATG; longer recovery; worse 1-year graft function than steroid-responsive
- Late ACR: Worse prognosis than early ACR; associated with de novo DSA development in some

### 2.2 Antibody-Mediated Rejection (AMR) Treatment

**Acute AMR (acute, aggressive course within days-weeks):**

First-line therapies (combination approach often used):

**Plasmapheresis/immunoadsorption:**
- Goal: Remove circulating alloantibodies (DSA)
- Plasmapheresis: Exchanges plasma for albumin/FFP; removes 60-70% DSA per session
- Immunoadsorption (more specific): Selectively removes HLA/endothelial antibodies
- Dosing: Daily × 3-5 sessions, then alternate days × 5-10 sessions
- Concurrent: IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) 2 g/kg to provide replacement antibodies
- Monitoring: DSA level, MFI changes; expect decline if treatment effective

**Rituximab:**
- Anti-CD20 antibody (B-cell depletion)
- Dosing: 375 mg/m² IV weekly × 1-4 doses
- Rationale: Reduce B-cell production of antibodies
- Timing: Often given during plasmapheresis course

**IV Immunoglobulin (IVIG):**
- Mechanism: Non-specific antibody replacement; competitive inhibition of DSA binding
- Dosing: 2 g/kg IV single dose or divided doses
- Concurrent with plasmapheresis (replace immunoglobulin removed by pheresis)

**Bortezomib (proteasome inhibitor) - emerging:**
- Depletes antibody-secreting plasma cells
- 1.3 mg/m² IV, day 1, 4, 8, 11
- Most experience in desensitization; limited acute AMR data
- Toxicity: Peripheral neuropathy, hypotension, infection

**Concurrent IS adjustments (AMR):**
- **Increase CNI:** Higher target levels (12-15 ng/mL)
- **Avoid calcineurin inhibitor:** Some protocols switch to belatacept (costly, not always available)
- **Add corticosteroids:** Methylprednisolone boluses (500-1000 mg daily × 3 days)
- **Maximize antimetabolite:** Ensure optimal MPA dosing

**Monitoring response:**
- Creatinine daily
- DSA levels weekly (MFI trend; expect decline if treatment working)
- Biopsy (some centers): Repeat biopsy 2-4 weeks post-treatment to assess response
- C4d, microvascular inflammation should improve

**Outcomes AMR:**
- Acute AMR: 40-60% achieve remission with aggressive therapy
- Late acute AMR: Worse prognosis; often progresses to chronic AMR/ABMR
- Even with treatment, many progress to graft dysfunction
- Graft survival: AMR has worse long-term prognosis than ACR

## 3. EARLY NON-IMMUNOLOGIC COMPLICATIONS (DAYS-WEEKS)

### 3.1 Delayed Graft Function (DGF)

**Definition:** Requirement for dialysis in first post-operative week despite graft reperfusion

**Epidemiology:**
- Incidence: 20-30% from deceased donor kidneys; 5-10% living donor
- Higher with DCD kidneys: 30-50%
- Associated with: High KDPI donors, prolonged cold ischemia time, severe donor acute injury

**Risk factors:**
- Extended criteria donor
- DCD donation
- Prolonged cold ischemia (>12 hours)
- Older recipient age
- African American race

**Mechanism:**
- Ischemia-reperfusion injury
- Acute tubular necrosis (ATN)
- Intratubular cast formation/debris
- Endothelial swelling
- Delayed recovery of tubular function

**Clinical course:**
- Minimal/absent urine output despite adequate graft perfusion
- Creatinine declines slowly (days-weeks) as function recovers
- Most DGF resolves by 1-2 weeks; some persistent to 3-4 weeks
- Worse outcomes: DGF associated with increased rejection risk, worse 1-year function

**Management:**
- Continue dialysis as needed (usually every 2-3 days until creatinine stabilizes)
- Optimize fluid management (maintain euvolemia; avoid overload from dialysis interdialytic gains)
- Minimize nephrotoxins (NSAIDs, ACE-I/ARB initially if creatinine rising)
- Monitor electrolytes (hyperkalemia management critical)
- Monitor tacrolimus levels carefully (may need dose adjustment; delayed metabolism in setting of poor renal function)
- Distinguish from acute rejection (biopsy if creatinine not improving by 1-2 weeks OR accompanied by fever/graft tenderness)

### 3.2 Vascular Complications

**Renal artery thrombosis (RAT):**
- Incidence: 0.5-2%
- Presentation: Sudden anuria, pain, elevated LDH (tissue necrosis marker)
- Diagnosis: Doppler ultrasound (no flow); CT angiography if uncertain
- Risk factors: Small donor artery, prolonged ischemia, anastomotic technique
- Management: **Thrombectomy if <24-48 hours** (urgent surgical intervention) vs. medical management (anticoagulation) if delayed presentation
- Prognosis: Most result in graft loss; recovery rare

**Renal artery stenosis (RAS):**
- Incidence: 1-5%
- Timing: Usually months-years post-transplant
- Presentation: Hypertension (often resistant), graft dysfunction
- Diagnosis: Doppler ultrasound (peak systolic velocity >2 m/s, systolic/diastolic ratio >3), renal artery angiography
- Management: **Angioplasty ± stent** (preferred); rarely surgical bypass if multiple stenosis
- Prognosis: Good with intervention; prevents graft loss

**Renal vein thrombosis:**
- Incidence: 0.5-1%
- Presentation: Pain, hematuria, elevated LDH
- Diagnosis: Doppler ultrasound or CT angiography
- Management: Anticoagulation ± thrombectomy (less successful than arterial intervention)
- Prognosis: Often results in graft loss

---

### 3.3 Urologic Complications

**Urine leak/urinary fistula:**
- Incidence: 1-5%
- Timing: Usually first 2-4 weeks (earlier: anastomotic disruption; later: ischemic necrosis of ureter)
- Presentation: Elevated serum creatinine (creatinine in peritoneal fluid), fever, drain output, peritonitis
- Diagnosis: CT with contrast (extravasation), imaging through drain
- Risk factors: Obesity, ischemic injury to distal ureter, anastomotic technique, ureteric obstruction
- Management: **Surgical re-exploration with repair** (if significant leak early) or **percutaneous drain placement** (if small, contained leak; may heal spontaneously)
- Prevention: Meticulous surgical technique, tension-free anastomosis, preservation of ureteric blood supply

**Ureteric obstruction:**
- Incidence: 1-2%
- Timing: Early (anastomotic stenosis, kinking) or late (fibrosis, stones)
- Presentation: Rising creatinine, hydronephrosis on ultrasound
- Diagnosis: Ultrasound (hydronephrosis), retrograde pyelography
- Management: **Percutaneous nephrostomy** (temporizing) or **surgical repair** (definitive)
- Prevention: Tension-free anastomosis, appropriate technique

**Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR):**
- Incidence: 40-50% (high because ureter anastomosed to bladder dome, not submucosal tunnel)
- Clinical significance: Usually asymptomatic; rarely causes symptoms or complications
- Management: Surveillance; address if recurrent symptomatic UTIs

### 3.4 Lymphocele

**Definition:** Lymph collection around transplant, usually self-limited

**Incidence:** 5-20% (varies by surgical technique)

**Presentation:** Usually asymptomatic; may have lower abdominal fullness
- Symptomatic: Leg edema (lymphatic obstruction), lower abdominal pain, fever (infected lymphocele)

**Diagnosis:** Ultrasound or CT (shows fluid collection without septations, unlike hematoma)

**Management:**
- Asymptomatic: Observation (usually resolve spontaneously)
- Symptomatic: Percutaneous drainage ± sclerosis (ethanol, OK-432)
- Infected: Drainage + antibiotics

---

### 3.5 Infectious Complications (Early Post-Op)

**Surgical site infection:**
- Incidence: 2-5%
- Presentation: Wound erythema, purulence, fever
- Management: Antibiotics, wound care, possible re-closure

**Urinary tract infection:**
- Incidence: 10-20% (higher with indwelling catheter)
- Presentation: Dysuria, frequency, fever, pyuria
- Management: Remove catheter; oral antibiotics if uncomplicated; IV if systemic signs

**Bacteremia/sepsis:**
- Rare but life-threatening
- Management: Blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotics, source control

## 4. SUMMARY AND KEY CONCEPTS

1. **Acute cellular rejection (ACR):** 10-20% incidence; steroid-responsive in 70-80%; rATG for resistant cases

2. **Acute antibody-mediated rejection (AMR):** 2-5% incidence; more aggressive; requires plasmapheresis, rituximab, IVIG

3. **Early presentation:** Rising creatinine, fever, graft tenderness; biopsy mandatory for diagnosis

4. **Differential diagnosis critical:** Infection, CNI toxicity, dehydration, vascular complication must be excluded

5. **Early intervention:** Treat rejection promptly; steroid-responsive rejection has better prognosis than delayed treatment

6. **Non-immunologic complications:** DGF, vascular, urologic, infectious; early detection essential

7. **Monitoring:** Daily creatinine, CNI levels, urinalysis in first weeks post-transplant
