# DOCUMENT 14: KIDNEY TRANSPLANT - CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE AND LONG-TERM GRAFT DYSFUNCTION

## Executive Summary

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) developing in kidney allografts—termed chronic allograft dysfunction (CAD) or chronic allograft failure—is the leading cause of long-term graft loss, accounting for >40% of graft failures beyond 1 year post-transplant. Chronic rejection with antibody-mediated injury and chronic allograft vasculopathy predominate, but other factors (recurrent/de novo glomerulonephritis, calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity, hypertension, proteinuria, metabolic factors) contribute to progressive graft dysfunction. This document comprehensively addresses the pathogenesis, diagnosis, monitoring, and management strategies to prevent progression of chronic graft dysfunction.

## 1. CHRONIC ALLOGRAFT DYSFUNCTION: DEFINITION AND EPIDEMIOLOGY

### 1.1 Terminology and Classification

**Chronic allograft rejection (CAR):**
- Slow, progressive graft dysfunction over months-years
- Immunologic mechanism: Indirect allorecognition predominates (T-cell dependent)
- Histology: Interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA), chronic vascular disease, glomerular disease

**Chronic allograft vasculopathy (CAV):**
- Progressive narrowing of allograft vessels (arterial and arteriolar)
- Leading manifestation of chronic rejection
- Distinct from atherosclerotic disease (though overlaps)

**Chronic antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR):**
- De novo DSA development
- Persistent C4d deposition, microvascular inflammation
- Progressive glomerular basement membrane (GBM) splitting ("double contour") on EM
- Increasingly recognized as major pathway to chronic failure

**Interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IF/TA):**
- Histologic finding; nonspecific etiology (multiple causes possible)
- Seen in: Chronic rejection, recurrent disease, CNI toxicity, others
- Associated with progressive creatinine decline

**Functional decline patterns:**
- Rapid: Creatinine increasing >0.2-0.3 mg/dL/month (aggressive; concerning for acute process)
- Gradual: Creatinine increasing 0.1-0.2 mg/dL/month (typical chronic rejection)
- Very slow: Creatinine stable or minimal change (stable long-term graft)

### 1.2 Epidemiology

**Incidence/prevalence:**
- 30-50% of recipients develop CKD stage 3-5 by 5 years post-transplant
- 10-15% develop ESRD requiring return to dialysis or retransplantation by 10 years
- Leading cause of graft loss (>40% of losses from year 1-10)

**Median graft survival (modern era):**
- Living donor kidney: 15-20 years
- Deceased donor kidney: 10-15 years
- (Varies significantly based on donor/recipient factors, immunosuppression)

**Risk factors for progression to chronic dysfunction:**

| Factor | Impact | Mechanism |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Pre-existing DSA** | Very high risk | Baseline AMR pathway |
| **De novo DSA development** | Very high risk | Ongoing AMR; triggers IF/TA |
| **Acute rejection episodes** | High risk | Cumulative injury; inflammatory signal |
| **Non-adherence to IS** | High risk | Under-immunosuppression leads to rejection |
| **CNI (tacrolimus)** | Moderate risk | Chronic nephrotoxicity (dose-dependent) |
| **Hypertension** | High risk | Progressive proteinuria, sclerosis |
| **Proteinuria** | High risk | Marker of injury; progressive glomerulosclerosis |
| **Donor age** | Moderate risk | Older donors = less functional reserve |
| **HLA mismatch** | Moderate risk | Chronic rejection pathway |
| **Donation type** | DCD > Deceased donor | More IF/TA in DCD kidneys |

## 2. PATHOGENESIS OF CHRONIC ALLOGRAFT DYSFUNCTION

### 2.1 Chronic Allograft Rejection Mechanisms

**Indirect allorecognition (dominant in chronic rejection):**
- Recipient antigen-presenting cells (APCs) present processed donor HLA peptides on recipient MHC
- Leads to: CD4+ T-cell help to B cells → DSA production
- Result: De novo DSA development (seen in 20-50% of recipients by 5 years)
- Consequence: Chronic ABMR with microvascular inflammation, GBM changes, progressive sclerosis

**Chronic allograft vasculopathy (CAV):**
- Progressive intimal thickening of donor vessels
- Smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration (abnormal remodeling)
- Contributing factors:
  - Immune (alloreactivity, DSA, complement activation)
  - Non-immune (hypertension, dyslipidemia, CNI toxicity, DM, smoking)
- Endothelial dysfunction: Loss of NO, increased ET-1
- Result: Progressive stenosis → ischemic injury → IF/TA

**Microvascular inflammation:**
- Glomerulitis (g score) and peritubular capillaritis (ptc score) in Banff classification
- Associated with DSA deposition and complement activation (C4d, C3d)
- Progressive accumulation of inflammatory cells
- Result: GBM splitting ("double contour"), glomerular basement membrane replication

### 2.2 Chronic Calcineurin Inhibitor (CNI) Nephrotoxicity

**Mechanism:**
- Dose-dependent vasoconstriction of afferent arteriole
- Reduced renal perfusion pressure
- Direct tubular toxicity (apoptosis, fibrosis)
- Activation of renin-angiotensin system (RAS)
- Fibrogenic pathways (TGF-β activation)

**Histologic findings:**
- Acute: Vacuolization of tubular epithelial cells
- Chronic: Arteriolar hyalinosis, IF/TA, striped fibrosis pattern

**Risk factors for CNI toxicity:**
- Higher tacrolimus levels (>10 ng/mL for extended period)
- Longer duration of high-level CNI exposure
- Reduced renal mass (single transplant)
- Pre-existing renal disease

**Prevention:**
- Target lower tacrolimus levels after first 3 months (goal 6-8 ng/mL; taper to 5-6 ng/mL by year 1+)
- CNI-sparing regimens (belatacept, mTOR inhibitors) in select patients
- Avoid nephrotoxic drugs (NSAIDs, ACE-I/ARB in early phase)

---

### 2.3 Recurrent and De Novo Glomerulonephritis

**Recurrent disease:**
- Original kidney disease reappears in allograft
- Risk: IgA nephropathy (~40-50% recurrence), lupus (~10-20%), ANCA-associated (<5%), others
- Prevents by: Disease remission control pre-transplant (for lupus, vasculitis)
- Management: Variable (usually requires more intensive IS for some diseases)

**De novo glomerulonephritis:**
- New glomerular disease not in recipient's original kidneys
- Mechanisms: Non-HLA antibodies, genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers
- Rarer than recurrent disease

## 3. DIAGNOSIS AND MONITORING

### 3.1 Clinical Presentation

**Asymptomatic graft dysfunction (most common):**
- Rising serum creatinine discovered on routine monitoring
- Progressive eGFR decline over months-years
- No symptoms (difference from acute rejection)

**Symptomatic presentations (less common):**
- Hypertension (often worsening, resistant to treatment)
- Edema (from proteinuria, reduced glomerular filtration)
- Anemia (from reduced EPO production; also inflammatory)
- Uremic symptoms (late; rare if monitoring adequate)

### 3.2 Monitoring Strategy

**Frequency of monitoring:**
- **First year:** Monthly (creatinine, eGFR, BUN)
- **Years 1-5:** Every 3 months (routine surveillance)
- **Year 5+:** Every 6-12 months (if stable)
- **More frequent if:** Rising creatinine trend, proteinuria, hypertension

**Key measurements:**

| Parameter | Frequency | Target/Goal |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Serum creatinine** | Monthly (year 1), then quarterly | Stable or slow decline |
| **eGFR** | Monthly (year 1), then quarterly | Preserve function >30 mL/min |
| **Proteinuria (24-hr or UACR)** | Every 6-12 months | <1 g/day (or UACR <30 mg/g) |
| **Blood pressure** | Every visit | <130/80 mmHg (cardioprotective) |
| **Tacrolimus level** | Monthly-quarterly | 5-8 ng/mL (maintenance) |
| **DSA testing** | Annually (or if creatinine rising) | Negative; if positive → escalate |
| **Graft ultrasound** | Baseline, then as indicated | Normal size, perfusion |

### 3.3 Diagnostic Evaluation if Creatinine Rising

**Historical data:**
- Baseline creatinine established (should have stable post-operative value)
- Rate of change (rapidly rising vs. slow decline)
- Prior acute rejection episodes
- Medication adherence assessed

**Laboratory studies:**
- **Serum creatinine, eGFR, BUN:** Calculate rate of decline
- **Urinalysis:** Proteinuria (>1 g/day significant), RBC, WBC
- **24-hour urine protein or UACR:** Quantify proteinuria
- **DSA testing:** Check for de novo DSA (important prognostic marker)
- **Tacrolimus level:** Ensure therapeutic (not sub- or supratherapeutic)
- **CBC, LFTs:** Assess for other complications

**Imaging:**
- **Renal ultrasound:** Size (atrophy suggests chronic), echogenicity, hydronephrosis, perfusion
- **Doppler ultrasound:** Assess vascular perfusion (RI, systolic/diastolic ratio)

**Renal allograft biopsy (diagnostic gold standard):**
- **Indications for biopsy:**
  - Creatinine rising unexpectedly (to guide management)
  - Protocol biopsy at 1-5 years (some centers; research/prognostic)
  - If considering IS reduction/conversion
  
- **Banff staging of IF/TA (fibrosis):**
  - Grade 0: Normal (<5% IF/TA)
  - Grade 1: Mild (5-25% IF/TA)
  - Grade 2: Moderate (26-50% IF/TA)
  - Grade 3: Severe (>50% IF/TA)

- **Chronic ABMR diagnosis (Banff 2017):**
  - Morphologic: Allograft glomerulopathy (ag score ≥1; GBM double contours on EM)
  - Immunologic: C4d ≥2 in peritubular capillaries OR DSA present
  - Chronic ABMR with active inflammation if g≥1 or ptc≥1

**Prognosis from biopsy:**
- IF/TA grade predicts graft outcome (higher grade = worse prognosis)
- De novo DSA presence indicates ongoing alloreactivity (worse)
- Chronic ABMR indicates progression pathway (requires aggressive management)

## 4. MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC GRAFT DYSFUNCTION

### 4.1 Prevention Strategies (All Recipients)

**1. Optimize immunosuppression:**
- **Target tacrolimus levels lower** in maintenance phase:
  - Year 1-2: 6-8 ng/mL
  - Year 2+: 5-7 ng/mL (or even 4-6 ng/mL if stable)
  - Reduces CNI nephrotoxicity while maintaining adequate rejection prevention
  
- **Minimize corticosteroids:**
  - Taper prednisolone to ≤5 mg/day by 6 months
  - Consider discontinuation in low-risk recipients
  - Balances bone health, metabolic benefits against rejection risk

- **Maximize antimetabolite:**
  - MPA 1-1.5 g BID (maximize tolerated dose)
  - Provides additional rejection prevention
  - Allows CNI reduction

**2. Manage hypertension aggressively:**
- **Goal blood pressure:** <130/80 mmHg (cardioprotective per guidelines)
- **First-line agents:** ACE inhibitor or ARB (renoprotective)
  - Caveat: May increase creatinine initially (expected; reduces glomerular hyperfiltration)
  - Risk: Hyperkalemia; monitor K+ carefully
  
- **Second-line:** Amlodipine (avoid diltiazem, verapamil = interact with CNI)
- **Beta-blocker** if indicated (post-MI, HF)
- **Thiazide/loop diuretic** if volume overloaded

**3. Reduce proteinuria:**
- **ACE inhibitor/ARB:** Primary agent (RAS blockade reduces proteinuria)
- **Restrict sodium:** <2.3 g/day (reduces proteinuria, aids BP control)
- **Minimize NSAIDs:** Avoid; can precipitate acute kidney injury
- **Target:** UACR <30 mg/g or 24-hour protein <1 g/day

**4. Manage lipids:**
- **Statin:** All transplant recipients should be on statin (dyslipidemia from IS, cardiovascular risk)
- **Goal LDL:** <100 mg/dL (individualize based on risk)
- **Triglycerides:** Manage if elevated (associated with graft dysfunction)

**5. Metabolic management:**
- **Blood glucose:** Tight glycemic control (HbA1c <7.5%)
- **Weight:** Maintain healthy BMI (obesity worsens outcomes)
- **Exercise:** Regular physical activity
- **Smoking cessation:** Mandatory

**6. Medication adherence:**
- **Patient education:** Emphasize critical importance
- **Adherence monitoring:** Assess at each visit
- **Barriers identification:** Address transportation, cost, understanding
- **Interventions:** Pill organizers, reminder apps, support groups

**7. Avoid nephrotoxic agents:**
- **NSAIDs:** Absolute avoidance (especially if creatinine rising)
- **Contrast agents:** Use IV hydration; minimize exposure
- **Aminoglycosides:** Avoid if possible

### 4.2 Management if Chronic Dysfunction Develops

**Early detection (creatinine rising 0.1-0.2 mg/dL/month):**

1. **Ensure medication adherence:** Assess IS compliance; obtain tacrolimus level
2. **Optimize current IS:** Increase CNI level to upper range; maximize antimetabolite
3. **Intensify non-IS interventions:** Hypertension control, proteinuria reduction, lifestyle
4. **Biopsy consideration:** If progressive; guides specific diagnosis
5. **Monitor frequently:** Monthly labs; assess response to intensification

**If de novo DSA detected:**
- Aggressive management needed
- **Plasmapheresis ± IVIG ± rituximab** (may slow progression)
- **IS intensification:** Higher CNI target
- **Monitor closely:** Monthly DSA levels, creatinine trend

**If chronic ABMR confirmed on biopsy:**
- Similar aggressive approach as above
- Some centers use complement inhibition (eculizumab, pegcetacoplan) - emerging data

**If progressive despite optimized IS (creatinine rising rapidly):**
- **Conversion from CNI to belatacept** (if not already on it): Some renal-sparing benefit
- **Addition of mTOR inhibitor** (sirolimus) in select cases: Anti-proliferative, renal-sparing
- **Reduce CNI significantly** if toxicity suspected (though progression may worsen from under-immunosuppression)
- **Referral for clinical trials:** Advanced therapies being studied

### 4.3 Endpoint Considerations

**When to discuss transplant failure possibility:**
- eGFR <20 mL/min: Begin dialysis planning
- Creatinine >4-5 mg/dL: Discuss modality options
- Rapid decline: Prepare for return to dialysis/retransplantation

**Options at transplant failure:**
- **Return to dialysis:** Resume hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis
- **Retransplantation:** If another deceased/living donor available; discuss timing (usually >6 months after graft loss)
- **Transplant nephrectomy:** Rare; only if persistent hematuria, infection, or recurrent disease risk

## 5. SUMMARY AND KEY CONCEPTS

1. **Chronic allograft dysfunction:** Leading cause of graft loss >1 year; multifactorial (rejection, CNI toxicity, hypertension, proteinuria)

2. **De novo DSA development:** Major risk factor; seen in 20-50% recipients by 5 years

3. **Chronic ABMR:** Increasingly recognized as major pathway to failure; double contours, C4d deposition

4. **CNI nephrotoxicity:** Dose-dependent; minimize levels by year 1+

5. **Monitoring strategy:** Serial creatinine, proteinuria, DSA, blood pressure; protocol biopsies informative

6. **Prevention first:** Tight hypertension, proteinuria reduction, ACE-I/ARB, statin, adherence support

7. **Early intervention:** If creatinine rising, escalate IS and non-pharmacologic measures

8. **Median graft survival:** 15-20 years living donor; 10-15 years deceased donor (variable based on factors)
