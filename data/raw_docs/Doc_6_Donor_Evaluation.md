# DOCUMENT 6: DONOR SELECTION, EVALUATION, AND BRAIN DEATH DECLARATION

## Executive Summary

Donor quality directly impacts transplant outcomes—superior donors yield superior graft survival. Donor evaluation encompasses medical optimization to reduce perioperative complications, assessment of organ-specific function and safety, and determination that death has occurred (brain death declaration). Extended criteria donors (older donors, those with medical comorbidities, prolonged ischemia time) provide alternatives to standard criteria donors for candidates with prolonged waiting times but carry increased risk of graft dysfunction and recipient mortality. This document comprehensively addresses donor medical evaluation, risk stratification, and the medical-legal aspects of brain death determination and organ procurement.

## 1. DONOR CLASSIFICATION AND RISK STRATIFICATION

### 1.1 Standard Criteria Donor (SCD) vs. Extended Criteria Donor (ECD)

#### Standard Criteria Donor (SCD)

**Definition:** Donor meeting all traditional criteria (now being reconsidered; definition becoming obsolete)

**Classical criteria (OPTN/UNOS legacy definition):**
- Age 10-59 years
- No hypertension (or well-controlled)
- No diabetes
- Serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL
- Hemodynamically stable
- No recent malignancy
- Negative cultures
- Acceptable organ function on assessment

**Outcomes:** 
- Median kidney graft survival ~15-20 years (depending on recipient age, HLA matching)
- Liver graft survival: 80% at 5 years
- Heart: 1-year survival >80%

#### Extended Criteria Donor (ECD)

**Definition (OPTN/UNOS, 2002-2020):** Any donor NOT meeting ALL standard criteria

**Original ECD criteria (now increasingly replaced by KDRI/KDPI):**
- Age >60 years, OR
- Age 50-59 with serum creatinine >1.5 mg/dL or hypertension, OR
- Age 50-59 with any 2 of: hypertension, abnormal histology (biopsy), creatinine >1.5

**Clinical significance:**
- ~43% of deceased donors meet historical ECD criteria
- Graft half-life shortened: 8-10 years (vs. 15+ for SCD)
- Higher mortality in recipients receiving ECD organs: HR 1.3-1.5

#### Kidney Donor Risk Index (KDRI) and Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI)

Modern quantitative approach replaces categorical ECD definition:

**KDRI formula:** Incorporates multiple donor factors into risk score:
- Age (exponential relationship; older = higher risk)
- Sex (female donors higher risk)
- Race/ethnicity (Black race higher risk; Hispanic lower risk)
- Hypertension history
- Diabetes history
- Serum creatinine
- Cause of death (anoxia, cerebrovascular accident worst)
- Hepatitis C antibody status

**KDPI (Kidney Donor Profile Index):** Percentile ranking relative to national donor population
- KDPI 0-20%: Highest quality donors
- KDPI 20-35%: Very good
- KDPI 35-50%: Good
- KDPI 50-65%: Acceptable
- KDPI 65-85%: Marginal utility
- KDPI >85%: Potentially better to decline (organ may last <10 years)

**Clinical application:**
- Allocation algorithms: UNOS prioritizes recipients by KDPI (better kidneys to better-matched recipients)
- Informed consent: KDPI shared with potential recipients
- Decision-making: Some recipients decline very high KDPI organs; others accept knowing reduced longevity

**Outcomes by KDPI:**
- KDPI <35%: 25-year graft half-life (excellent)
- KDPI 35-85%: 10-20 year graft half-life (variable)
- KDPI >85%: <10 year graft half-life (marginal; consider only if waiting >5 years)

### 1.2 Donation After Cardiac Death (DCD) and Donation After Brain Death (DBD)

#### Donation After Brain Death (DBD - Standard)

**Definition:** Donor meeting neurologic criteria for death; organ procurement while heart still beating (donor on ventilator)

**Advantages:**
- Longer warm ischemia time acceptable (5-30 minutes before organ removal vs. 0-1 minute DCD)
- More organs recovered (multi-organ; DCD limited to heart, liver, kidneys)
- Better outcomes (shorter ischemia time)
- Clearer clinical pathway

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires declaration of brain death (more complex determination than cardiac death)
- Donor may have multiple trauma/hemorrhage (limits usability)
- ICU management required; costs higher

#### Donation After Cardiac Death (DCD)

**Definition:** Donor pronounced dead by cardiopulmonary criteria; organ procurement follows cardiac arrest (warm ischemia occurs before organ removal)

**Mechanism:**
- Withdrawal of life support or after cardiac arrest
- After cardiac standstill × 5 minutes (variable; some centers 2-3 min; some 10 min)
- Pronouncement of death
- Rapid surgical team intervention (within 10-30 minutes)
- Organ procurement begins

**Organs recovered:**
- Kidney (most common; tolerates warm ischemia well)
- Liver (selected cases; <25-30 min warm ischemia acceptable)
- Heart (rare; emerging; requires ultra-short ischemia <20 min)
- Pancreas (rarely; longer ischemia limits use)

**Advantages:**
- Expands donor pool (many potential DCD donors cannot be DBD)
- Ethical clarity: Death declared before organ procurement
- No controversy regarding timing of death declaration

**Disadvantages:**
- **Warm ischemia injury:** Time between cardiac arrest and organ preservation
  - Kidney DCD: 10-15 min warm ischemia ~equivalent to 30+ min cold ischemia
  - Progressive IRI (ischemia-reperfusion injury) from warm ischemia
- **Delayed graft function (DGF):** Higher incidence (30-40% vs. 20-25% DBD)
- **Shorter graft half-life:** 8-12 years (vs. 15+ years DBD)
- **Recipient complications:** Higher acute kidney injury risk

**Outcomes DCD vs. DBD kidney:**
- 5-year graft survival: ~80% (DCD) vs. 85% (DBD)
- Median graft half-life: 9.8 years (DCD) vs. 15.3 years (DBD)
- Delayed graft function: 37% (DCD) vs. 24% (DBD)

## 2. DONOR EVALUATION AND OPTIMIZATION

### 2.1 Initial Assessment

#### Identification and Referral

**Who is a potential donor?**
- Patient with severe, irreversible brain injury (neurologic determination of death pending)
- Patient with cardiac standstill (potential DCD)
- Consent obtained from family/designated surrogate
- No contraindications to organ donation

**Barriers to donation:**
- Active malignancy (except primary CNS)
- Uncontrolled infection (sepsis, CNS infection; active tuberculosis, syphilis)
- HIV-positive (now acceptable with appropriate recipients)
- Hepatitis B or C (now recoverable in select recipients; routine in some centers)
- HTLV-1 (relative contraindication; transmission risk)
- Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (absolute)
- Active drug abuse (relative; some centers procure from recent users)

### 2.2 Organ-Specific Evaluation

#### Cardiovascular Assessment (All Organs)

**History:**
- Prior myocardial infarction
- Hypertension (duration, treatment, control)
- Tobacco/cocaine use
- Cause of death (anoxia, CVA increase coronary atherosclerosis risk)

**Physical examination:**
- Blood pressure, heart rate, perfusion status
- Peripheral edema, signs of heart failure

**Diagnostic studies:**
- **EKG:** Baseline rhythm, ischemic changes, arrhythmia
- **Troponin:** Elevations suggest myocardial injury (from brain death, trauma, or prior CAD)
- **Echocardiography:** 
  - LVEF assessment (critical for heart and liver donors; assess contractility)
  - Structural abnormalities
  - Pericardial effusion
  - Valve disease
- **Chest X-ray:** Pulmonary edema, pneumonia, heart size, other pathology
- **Coronary angiography:** For heart donors; age >50, risk factors, abnormal EKG, elevated troponin

#### Renal Function Assessment (Kidney Donors)

**Serum creatinine:**
- Baseline creatinine (often baseline unknown; use age-based estimates if not documented)
- Baseline estimated GFR calculated
- Higher creatinine → KDRI component; increases risk score

**Urine output:**
- Monitor closely pre-procurement
- Adequate hydration goal: UOP >100-200 mL/hour
- Osmotic diuretics (mannitol), loop diuretics (furosemide) used to maintain urine output
- Oliguria/anuria concerning for acute kidney injury or preexisting disease

**Renal artery intima-media thickness:** Not routinely measured but available on ultrasound if concern for atherosclerotic disease

#### Hepatic Function Assessment (Liver Donors)

**Laboratory studies:**
- AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, bilirubin (baseline liver function)
- PT/INR (synthetic function; reflects coagulation factor production)
- Albumin (synthetic function marker)
- Ammonia (if encephalopathy concern)

**Viral serology:**
- Hepatitis A antibody (indicates immunity)
- Hepatitis B surface antigen, core antibody, surface antibody
- Hepatitis C antibody, RNA (if seropositive)
- Hepatitis E (if endemic region or concern)
- HIV (if risk factors)

**Imaging:**
- Abdominal ultrasound: Liver echotexture, cirrhosis assessment, portal vein patency
- CT/MRI (if ultrasound abnormal): Characterize lesions, assess fatty infiltration
- Doppler ultrasound: Portal/hepatic artery flow confirmation

**Histologic assessment (optional):**
- Percutaneous liver biopsy: If macrovascular steatosis suspected
- Goal: <30% macrovascular steatosis acceptable
- Degree of steatosis influences donor risk profile

#### Pulmonary Function Assessment (Lung Donors)

**History:**
- Tobacco use (significant risk factor for respiratory complications)
- Aspiration risk (gastric contents, foreign bodies)
- Pneumonia, ARDS

**Physical examination:**
- Breath sounds; evidence of consolidation, rales
- Signs of pulmonary edema

**Diagnostic studies:**
- **Chest X-ray:** Infiltrates, pulmonary edema, aspiration, endotracheal tube position
- **Arterial blood gas:** PaO2 on FiO2 100% (goal: PaO2/FiO2 ratio >300 for acceptable donor lung)
- **Bronchoscopy:** Assess airway secretions, aspiration, lower airway assessment
  - Clear secretions favorable
  - Purulent secretions → increased infection risk
  - Aspiration → relative contraindication

**Acceptability criteria for lung:**
- PaO2/FiO2 ratio >300
- Clear chest X-ray (or minor infiltrates only)
- Negative sputum culture
- Tobacco use history <20 pack-years
- Age <70 years (relative)
- Normal oxygenation on low FiO2

#### Pancreatic Assessment (Pancreas Donors)

**Laboratory:**
- Amylase, lipase (elevations suggest pancreatitis; contraindication)
- Glucose (diabetes → relative contraindication; impaired beta-cell function)

**History:**
- Alcohol use (pancreatitis risk)
- Trauma to abdomen (concern for pancreatic injury)
- Hyperglycemia history

**Imaging:**
- Abdominal imaging: Pancreatic edema, necrosis, trauma
- Usually incorporated into routine abdominal imaging

**Risk factors for pancreas graft failure:**
- Elevated amylase/lipase
- Donor age >50
- Body mass index >30
- African American donors (worse outcomes)
- Prolonged ischemia time

### 2.3 Donor Hemodynamic Management and Optimization

**Goals:**
- Maintain adequate perfusion pressure (MAP >65-70 mmHg)
- Optimize urine output (100-200+ mL/hour)
- Minimize complications (myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, sepsis)
- Maximize organ quality/utilization

#### Fluid Management

**Initial phase:**
- Assess intravascular volume status (CVP, PAOP if available)
- Cautious fluid administration (balanced crystalloid; avoid excessive sodium)
- Hypervolemia → pulmonary edema, graft dysfunction
- Hypovolemia → hypotension, acute kidney injury

**Maintenance:**
- Isotonic crystalloid (normal saline, lactated Ringer)
- Target urine output 1-2 mL/kg/hour (goal 100-300 mL/hour)
- Avoid hypotonic solutions (hypoosmolarity worsens cerebral edema)

#### Vasopressor Support

**Indications:**
- MAP <65 mmHg despite adequate fluid resuscitation
- Hypotension secondary to brain death (loss of sympathetic tone) or medications

**Agents (in order of preference):**
1. **Vasopressin:** Hormone released post-brain death; physiologic replacement
   - Dosing: 1 unit bolus, then 0.5-4 units/hour infusion
   - Advantage: Improves cardiac output and graft perfusion
   - Often first choice post-brain death

2. **Dopamine:** Catecholamine
   - Low-dose (2-5 μg/kg/min): Renal vasodilation; increased urine output
   - Intermediate (5-10 μg/kg/min): Inotropic; increased cardiac output
   - High-dose (>10 μg/kg/min): Vasoconstrictive
   - Concern: May cause arrhythmia

3. **Norepinephrine:** Catecholamine
   - Strong vasoconstrictor and inotropic
   - Preferred if dopamine ineffective
   - Dosing: 0.05-0.3 μg/kg/minute

**Avoid:** Phenylephrine (pure vasoconstriction; reduces cardiac output)

#### Hormonal Replacement (Post-Brain Death)

**Brain death → loss of hypothalamic-pituitary axis function:**
- Cessation of growth hormone, TSH, ACTH secretion
- Excessive ADH release (from posterior pituitary neurons)
- Massive catecholamine surge → myocardial damage (myocardial stunning)

**Recommended hormone replacement:**
- **Methylprednisolone:** 15 mg/kg IV (supraphysiologic; immunoprotective, anti-inflammatory)
- **Desmopressin (DDAVP):** 1 μg IV Q6h (ADH replacement; reduce polyuric insipidus)
- **Thyroid hormone (T3 or levothyroxine):** Some protocols; improves hemodynamics
  - T3: 4 μg bolus then infusion 3 μg/hour (controversial; mixed outcomes)
- **Insulin:** If glucose >200 mg/dL (avoid hyperglycemia; graft injury)

**Controversy:** No consensus on hormone replacement; mixed outcomes in trials

#### Infection Control

**Prophylaxis:**
- **Antibiotics:** Broad-spectrum if fever/elevated WBC
  - Typical: Ceftriaxone 1 g IV Q12h (or cefotaxime) + vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg Q8-12h
  - Adjust for renal function
  - Continue until organ procurement or stop if cultures negative
  
- **Antifungal:** If risk factors (prolonged ICU stay, central lines, immunosuppression)

**Monitoring:**
- Blood/urine cultures (baseline, daily if prolonged organ procurement)
- Positive cultures → notify transplant teams; adjust prophylaxis
- Not necessarily contraindication if appropriate treatment

## 3. BRAIN DEATH DETERMINATION (NEUROLOGIC DETERMINATION OF DEATH)

### 3.1 Overview

**Definition:** Irreversible cessation of ALL functions of entire brain, including brainstem

**Legal basis:** Adopted in all 50 US states; internationally variable (some countries only recognize cardiac death)

**Clinical significance:** Allows organ procurement while heart still beating (DBD); preserves organ quality for transplantation

**Controversy:** None medically/legally in most modern countries; ethically/religiously sensitive in some populations

### 3.2 Prerequisites for Brain Death Determination

Before initiating brain death evaluation, ALL prerequisites must be met:

#### 1. **Coma or Unresponsiveness Confirmed**
- Patient unresponsive to external stimuli
- No purposeful responses to pain (distinguish from reflexive movements)
- Clinical exam documents unresponsiveness clearly

#### 2. **Cause of Coma Established**
- Neuroimaging (CT/MRI): Identifies structural lesion OR
- Clinical evaluation: Establishes diagnosis of irreversible brain injury
  - Traumatic brain injury (head trauma, epidural/subdural hemorrhage)
  - Ischemic stroke (large anterior circulation or basilar artery)
  - Intracranial hemorrhage (intracerebral, subarachnoid)
  - Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (cardiac arrest, anoxia)
  - Severe CNS infection (meningitis, encephalitis)
- Goal: Ensure irreversibility; exclude reversible coma (toxins, metabolic)

#### 3. **Body Temperature ≥32°C (90°F)**
- Hypothermia slows metabolism; can mimic brain death
- "Nobody is dead until they're warm and dead"
- Rewarm patient before brain death evaluation if hypothermic

#### 4. **Metabolic/Toxic Causes Excluded**
- **Drugs/toxins:** Sedatives (benzodiazepines, barbiturates), opioids, neuromuscular blockers
  - Serum/urine drug screen
  - Hold sedatives ≥5 half-lives before evaluation
  - Neuromuscular blockers: Assess train-of-four; must show recovery before exam
  
- **Metabolic abnormalities:**
  - Electrolyte disturbances (hyponatremia, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia)
  - Hypoglycemia
  - Renal/hepatic failure
  - Severe acidosis
  - Laboratory studies: BMP, glucose, liver function tests, renal function

- **Hypothermia:** Exclude (see above)

#### 5. **Reversible Causes Excluded**
- **Shock:** Hypotensive patients cannot meet brain death criteria (inadequate cerebral perfusion → reversible neurologic findings)
  - Target: SBP >90 mmHg, MAP >65 mmHg
  - Support with fluids and vasopressors as needed
  
- **Encephalitis/meningitis:** Treat with antibiotics ≥7 days before determination (allow time for treatment effect)

- **Neuromuscular blockade:** Must be reversed and documented as such

---

### 3.3 Clinical Examination for Brain Death

#### General Principles

**Examiner qualifications:**
- Two independent physicians required (each must perform full exam)
- Physicians must be:
  - Attending-level physicians
  - Experienced in neurologic examination
  - **NOT involved in organ procurement or transplantation** (conflict of interest)
  - Different physicians perform exam (ideally; some protocols allow same physician at different times)

**Timing:**
- Time interval between exams varies by protocol/regulation:
  - Adults: 6-12 hours typical (some accept 4 hours with ancillary testing)
  - Infants 7 days-2 months: 48-hour interval
  - Infants 2-12 months: 24-hour interval
  - Children >1 year: Same as adults

**Documentation:**
- Detailed written documentation of each examination
- Time of examination recorded
- Both physicians must document findings independently

#### Components of Brain Death Examination

**1. Absence of Cerebral Function**
- Unresponsiveness to external stimuli
- No purposeful responses (distinguish from reflex responses)
- No vocalizations
- No eye opening (spontaneous or to stimuli)

**2. Absence of Brainstem Reflexes**

| Reflex | Test | Normal Response | Brain Dead Response |
|--------|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Pupillary light reflex** | Shine light in pupils | Constrict | No response; pupils mid-range (4-6 mm) or dilated |
| **Corneal reflex (blink reflex)** | Touch cornea with cotton wisp | Blink | No response |
| **Oculocephalic reflex (doll's eyes)** | Rotate head side-to-side; eyes move opposite head | Eyes follow; move opposite head direction | Eyes stay fixed to midline (no movement) |
| **Caloric reflex (ice water calorics)** | Irrigate ear canal with ice water | Eyes move toward stimulated side | No eye movement |
| **Gag reflex** | Stimulate posterior pharynx | Gag | No response |
| **Cough reflex** | Pass endotracheal tube suction down | Cough | No response |

**3. Absence of Motor Responses**
- No movement to stimuli
- Distinguish:
  - **Purposeful movement:** Withdrawal from pain, reaching, grasping (incompatible with brain death)
  - **Reflexive movement:** Spinal reflexes (acceptable in brain death)
    - Flexor/extensor reflexes
    - Babinski reflex
    - These occur below level of brainstem

- **Spinal reflex test:** Apply noxious stimulus (pinch) → reflex withdrawal compatible with brain death

**4. Apnea Test (Most Important; Confirms Brainstem Death)**

**Purpose:** Verify absent respiratory drive; confirm brainstem death

**Procedure:**
1. Pre-oxygenate: 100% O2 × 10 minutes (target PaO2 >200 mmHg)
2. Disconnect ventilator
3. Provide passive oxygenation (via endotracheal tube): Oxygen at 6-8 L/minute
4. Observe chest for respiratory effort × 8-10 minutes
5. Check arterial blood gas at end: Target CO2 >60 mmHg (to stimulate respiratory drive if brainstem intact)
6. If no respiratory effort observed AND CO2 >60 mmHg → **apnea test POSITIVE** (supports brain death)

**Positive test criteria (any ONE):)**
- No respiratory effort with CO2 ≥60 mmHg, OR
- No respiratory effort with increase in CO2 ≥20 mmHg from baseline

**Apnea test failure (inconclusive):**
- If blood pressure drops <90 mmHg systolic (hypoxemia)
- If SpO2 drops <85% (hypoxemia)
- If cardiac arrhythmia develops
→ Reconnect ventilator; retry later or perform ancillary test

---

### 3.4 Ancillary (Confirmatory) Tests

If clinical examination cannot be completed (e.g., apnea test fails from hemodynamic instability) or to shorten determination interval, ancillary tests may be used:

**Cerebral Blood Flow Studies:**
- **Radionuclide cerebral blood flow imaging (99m-Tc HMPAO or 99m-Tc ECD):** No intracerebral blood flow = brain death
- **Angiography:** No intracranial blood flow beyond skull = brain death
- Confirmatory; time-dependent
- Acceptable as sole determination test (some protocols) or adjunct

**Electroencephalography (EEG):**
- Absent electrical activity (flat line EEG)
- Highly specific (if flat)
- Not ideal (activity may persist despite brain death; surface recording)
- Most commonly used ancillary test in US

**Transcranial Doppler Ultrasonography:**
- Absent or reverberating flow in cerebral arteries
- Operator dependent
- More subjective than other tests

**Computed Tomography Perfusion (CTP):**
- Absent perfusion to brain parenchyma
- Emerging; limited experience

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):**
- Demonstrates extensive brain necrosis/liquefaction
- Not practical (time-consuming; contraindicated devices)

---

### 3.5 Documentation and Declaration

**Requirements:**
- Two independent physician examinations (or one exam + ancillary test)
- Complete neurologic examination documented
- Apnea test performed (or ancillary test if apnea test inconclusive)
- Irreversibility established
- Informed consent/discussion with family

**Declaration:**
- Physician declares "Patient is dead"
- Time of death = time of second physician examination (or ancillary test)
- Documented in medical record
- Family notified
- Organ procurement team notified

**Legal aspects:**
- Death declared by physicians; independent of organ donation discussion
- Organ procurement proceeds only with proper consent

---

## 4. SPECIFIC DONOR MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS

### 4.1 Donor Hemodynamics in the ICU

**Acute phase (immediately post-brain death):**
- Catecholamine surge (autonomic storm)
- Hypertension, tachycardia, arrhythmia
- Myocardial stunning (troponin elevation, LVEF decline)
- Manage: Sedation, vasodilation, continue mechanical ventilation

**Later phase (hours 1-48):**
- Loss of sympathetic tone
- Hypotension (usually)
- Bradycardia (less common)
- Polyuric insipidus (DI) from ADH loss
- Manage: Vasopressors, fluid management, hormone replacement

### 4.2 Procurement Sequence and Timing

**Operating room setup:**
- Multiple surgical teams (organ-specific) coordinate
- Careful timing: Minimize warm ischemia
- Sequence typically:
  1. **Liver:** Highest priority (smaller organs; first team ready)
  2. **Kidneys:** Often simultaneously with liver
  3. **Heart:** Last (depends on cardiac status)
  4. **Lungs:** If suitable donor

**Preservation:**
- **In situ flush:** Cold preservation solution infused antegrade through aorta; vena cava vented
  - Rapid organ cooling
  - Removal of RBCs (reduces IRI)
  - Typical: 2-4°C crystalloid or organ-specific solution
  
- **Organ removal:** Explantation on back-table; careful dissection
  
- **Final preservation:** Additional flush; placement in cold saline; transported in cooler

**Cold ischemia time:**
- Kidney: Acceptable up to 24-36 hours (but <12 hours preferred)
- Liver: Up to 12-15 hours (preferred <8 hours)
- Heart: <4 hours (usually <6 hours maximum)
- Lung: <6-8 hours (shorter preferred)
- Pancreas: <12-15 hours

## 5. SUMMARY AND KEY CONCEPTS

1. **Donor quality impacts outcomes:** KDRI/KDPI quantifies kidney donor quality; better kidneys achieve 20+ year graft survival

2. **Extended criteria donors:** Older, comorbid donors; acceptable for recipients with long waiting times; shorter graft survival expected

3. **DCD vs. DBD:** DCD expands donor pool but introduces warm ischemia injury; shorter graft half-life (9-10 years vs. 15+ years)

4. **Donor evaluation:** Organ-specific assessment (cardiac, renal, hepatic, pulmonary); optimization pre-procurement

5. **Brain death determination:** Legal death declaration; requires two independent physician exams with complete neurologic examination + apnea test (or ancillary test)

6. **Prerequisites:** Coma etiology established, temperature >32°C, metabolic/toxic/reversible causes excluded before exam

7. **Apnea test:** Critical; confirms brainstem death; requires CO2 >60 mmHg with no respiratory effort

8. **Donor management:** Optimize hemodynamics; hormone replacement; prevent infection; prepare for organ procurement
